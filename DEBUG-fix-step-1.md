# DEBUG: JavaScript Interop Fix Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

## Problem Analysis
JavaScript interop `InvalidOperationException` during server-side prerendering in `JoinSignalRGroupsAsync` method at line 664.

**Root Cause**: `JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync("eval", "window.currentSessionId = " + SessionId)` called during component initialization when JavaScript context is not available.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Move JavaScript interop to OnAfterRenderAsync âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Removed JavaScript interop call from `JoinSignalRGroupsAsync` 
- âœ… Added proper JavaScript interop in `OnAfterRenderAsync` with `firstRender` guard
- âœ… Added exception handling for JavaScript interop calls

### Step 2: Add firstRender check to prevent repeated calls âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… JavaScript interop only runs once after first render
- âœ… Proper lifecycle management implemented

### Step 3: Test fix and validate no JavaScript errors âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Application builds successfully
- âœ… Host Control Panel loads without JavaScript interop errors
- âœ… SignalR connections work correctly (session group and host group joins)
- âœ… JavaScript window.currentSessionId = 212 is set correctly
- âœ… TestShareAsset feature ready for testing

## Results
**SUCCESS**: JavaScript interop `InvalidOperationException` has been resolved. The problematic JavaScript call has been moved from component initialization to `OnAfterRenderAsync` with proper lifecycle guards.

**Log Evidence**:
```
[16:43:49 INF] [DEBUG-WORKITEM:hostcanvas:HOST] ðŸ“Š Set JavaScript window.currentSessionId = 212
[16:43:49 INF] COPILOT-DEBUG: Set window.currentSessionId = 212 for JavaScript
```

The Host Control Panel now initializes successfully without JavaScript interop errors during prerendering.
