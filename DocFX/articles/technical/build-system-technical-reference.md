# Build System Technical Reference

This document provides technical implementation details for the NOOR Canvas build system.

## Architecture

The build system uses:

- **MSBuild**: Primary build orchestration
- **dotnet CLI**: Cross-platform build execution
- **PowerShell Scripts**: Automated testing integration
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit validation

## Build Pipeline

### 1. Pre-Build Phase

- Dependency restoration
- Configuration validation
- Environment setup

### 2. Compilation Phase

- C# source compilation
- Blazor component processing
- Asset bundling

### 3. Post-Build Phase

- Automated test execution
- Build artifact validation
- Success/failure reporting

## Integration Points

- **Visual Studio Code Tasks**: `.vscode/tasks.json` integration
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Git Hooks**: `.hooks/` directory PowerShell scripts

## Configuration Files

- `SPA/NoorCanvas/NoorCanvas.csproj`: Project configuration
- `.vscode/tasks.json`: IDE task definitions
- `.hooks/post-build.ps1`: Automated test execution
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD definitions

## Performance Optimization

- Incremental builds using build artifact caching
- Smart test execution based on source code changes
- Parallel build execution where possible

## Troubleshooting

Common build issues and resolutions:

- File locking problems with running processes
- Dependency resolution failures
- Path resolution issues in PowerShell scripts
