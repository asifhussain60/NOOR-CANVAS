/**
 * Issue-119 Playwright Reorganization Validation Test
 * 
 * This test validates that the Playwright reorganization was successful:
 * - Tests run from new PlayWright/tests/ directory
 * - Artifacts are generated in correct locations
 * - Configuration paths are working properly
 * - Test discovery and execution functions normally
 * 
 * Test Categories:
 * - Directory Structure Validation: Confirm new paths exist and are accessible
 * - Configuration Testing: Validate config file loading and path resolution
 * - Basic Functionality: Ensure core testing features work from new location
 * - Artifact Generation: Verify reports/results/artifacts save to correct paths

/**
 * Test Execution Notes:
 * 
 * Run this test to validate the reorganization:
 * npx playwright test issue-119-playwright-reorganization-validation.spec.ts --headed
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - All tests should pass
 * - Artifacts should be generated in PlayWright/artifacts/
 * - Reports should be saved to PlayWright/reports/
 * - Results should be saved to PlayWright/results/
 * - VSCode Test Explorer should discover tests in new location
 * 
 * If any test fails, it indicates an issue with the reorganization that needs addressing.
