  - HOST STEP 5A/5B: Toast notification triggered
  - HOST STEP 6A/6B: UI StateHasChanged completed - Question visible in UI
  - HOST Q&A PROCESSING COMPLETE
- **Production Value:** Host interface real-time updates and UI state management visibility

#### **4. SessionCanvas.razor - QuestionReceived Event**
- **Trace Logs:** 21 canvas-side reception logging points  
- **Key Flow Steps:**
  - SESSIONCANVAS RECEIVES Q&A SIGNALR
  - CANVAS STEP 1: QuestionReceived event from SignalR
  - CANVAS STEP 2: Raw question data received
  - CANVAS STEP 3: Parsing question data from SignalR
  - CANVAS STEP 4: Creating QuestionData object
  - CANVAS STEP 5: QuestionData created (ID, Text, UserName)
  - CANVAS STEP 6A/6B: Question added to UI list
  - CANVAS STEP 7A/7B: StateHasChanged completed - Question visible in UI
  - SESSIONCANVAS Q&A PROCESSING COMPLETE
- **Production Value:** Participant interface real-time updates and bidirectional communication visibility

### **Original Request**
> "Add to Specific Pending Tasks: 4. Create a playwright test to verify the bidirectional broadcast between host control panel and Session canvas view is working. Gather log evidence to confirm. I want to see each step of the flow bidirectionally. Add trace level logs"

### **Delivered Results**
✅ **Playwright Test Created:** Complete bidirectional flow test with live application validation

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Logging Format**
```
[DEBUG-WORKITEM:canvas-qa:trace:{RequestId}] {STEP}: {Description} ;CLEANUP_OK
```

### **Request ID Tracking**
- Each Q&A operation gets a unique 8-character request ID
- Request IDs enable tracing individual operations across all components
- All related logs share the same request ID for correlation

### **Performance Impact**
- Trace logging uses `LogInformation` level with conditional cleanup markers
- Production deployment can filter logs using `;CLEANUP_OK` marker
- Minimal performance overhead due to structured logging implementation
