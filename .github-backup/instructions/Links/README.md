# Links Readme

This folder contains *live* project snapshots that `sync` keeps up-to-date.
They are machine-oriented inventories that Copilot uses to build context quickly.

- **Do not hand-edit** unless bootstrapping. `sync` should own these files.
- Files are designed to be *fully regenerated* and diffable.
