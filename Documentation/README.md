## üîÑ **Cleanup Status**

‚úÖ **Completed Actions:**
- Removed duplicate files (`*.backup`, duplicate trackers, etc.)
- Consolidated migration documentation into professional structure
- Moved learning session reports from TEMP to proper documentation structure
- Cleaned up generated artifacts (test reports, build files)
- Established single source of truth for each documentation topic

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

- **SPA/NoorCanvas/** - Main Blazor Server application
- **Tests/UI/** - Playwright TypeScript test suite
- **IssueTracker/** - Structured issue tracking system
- **Documentation/** - Consolidated documentation (this directory)
- **Workspaces/** - Development workspaces and utilities

## üöß **Guidelines**

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each feature should have one primary documentation file
2. **Professional Naming**: No placeholder names like "clean", "fixed", "new", "temp"
3. **Structured Organization**: Documentation organized by category (Testing, Migration, Analysis)
4. **Clear References**: This index provides navigation to all documentation
5. **Version Control**: All documentation changes are tracked in git history
