## Notes & Issues

### Implementation Notes
- Main application location: `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA`
- Helper tools location: `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\Tools`  
- Issue tracker organization: Status-based folder structure
- All console apps use .NET 8 with consistent CLI contracts
- **Testing Protocol**: Use `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of curl for API testing
- **Development Server**: IIS Express x64 on localhost:9090/9091 (HTTP/HTTPS)
- **Database**: AHHOME server with KSESSIONS_DEV/KQUR_DEV for development

### Blockers & Dependencies
- **Database Connection**: Health endpoint testing requires AHHOME server connectivity
- **SSL Certificate**: HTTPS testing needs trusted development certificate
- **External APIs**: Quran.com and Beautiful Islam API access required for content integration

### Testing Execution Notes
- **API Testing**: Use `Invoke-WebRequest -SkipCertificateCheck` (PowerShell 7+) or `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing` (PowerShell 5.1)
- **SignalR Testing**: Browser developer tools for WebSocket connection verification
- **Database Testing**: SQL Server Management Studio for direct database validation
- **Performance Testing**: Browser performance profiler for client-side metrics
- **Load Testing**: Consider tools like k6, Artillery, or NBomber for .NET integration
