# GitHub Copilot - Issue Resolution Protocol

## **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR ALL SESSIONS**

### **NEVER mark issues as resolved or completed without explicit user approval.**

## **Standard Practice Required:**

### 1. **Complete Technical Work**
- Implement all required functionality
- Perform testing and validation  
- Fix any bugs or errors
- Ensure build success

### 2. **Document Progress**
- Update todo lists with detailed progress
- Document what was accomplished in implementation notes
- Record any technical findings or discoveries
- Note any blockers or dependencies

### 3. **Present Findings**
- Summarize what has been completed technically
- Present evidence (build success, test results, etc.)
- Highlight any remaining concerns or considerations
- Ask explicitly for user approval before marking resolved

### 4. **Wait for User Confirmation**
- User must explicitly say phrases like:
  - "mark as resolved"
  - "this is complete" 
  - "approve this resolution"
  - "close this issue"
- Do NOT interpret general positive feedback as approval
- Do NOT assume completion based on technical success alone

### 5. **Only Then Update Status**
- Change status from ACTIVE to RESOLVED only after explicit approval
- Add resolution date and implementation details
- Update any dependent documentation

## **Current Context Reminder:**

**Where we are:** Successfully built fresh Host-SessionOpener.razor with all requirements implemented

**What's completed technically:**
- Fresh component with inline CSS conversion
- Session URL panel conditional visibility (@if ShowSessionUrlPanel)
- Complete database integration with cascading dropdowns  
- Responsive 2-column layout matching mock reference
- Build succeeded with no errors (11.1s)

**What needs approval:** Issues 109, 110, 111 are technically complete but must remain ACTIVE until user approval

## **Status Indicators to Use:**
- `ACTIVE` - Work in progress
- `ACTIVE - AWAITING USER APPROVAL` - Technical work complete, awaiting approval
- `RESOLVED` - Only after explicit user approval
- `DEFERRED` - User decides to postpone
- `CANCELLED` - User decides not to proceed
