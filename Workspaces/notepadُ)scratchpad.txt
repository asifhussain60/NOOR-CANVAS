End to end test instructions

1. Load https://localhost:9091/host/session-opener/{HostToken}
2. Click on "Access Host Control Panel" button.
This will load the #file:Host-SessionOpener.razor view. On the view Wait till all fields are lodaed. 


Revise all prompts where necessary, ensuring that the instructions are clear, cohesive, and harmonious. Each set of instructions should work seamlessly together, without any contradictions, to create a unified guiding framework. I want all files provided in a zip downloadable format with a version number attached to it.




Prompt template you can use:

Give me the complete [filename] as a single continuous code block, with no placeholders or ellipses. Show the entire file exactly as it should exist in my repo, formatted so it will not split into multiple blocks.

Generate a zip containing all my updated prompt/instruction files. Each file must be complete, including my original instructions and your added patches. There should be no placeholders, and the code should be formatted as a single code block internally, so that nothing is split. Do a before-and-after line count comparison so I can ensure you have not condensed the prompts





Follow instructions in workitem.prompt.md.
key: hostcanvas mode: apply test: false notes: Update #file:Host-SessionOpener.razor to also generate the https://localhost:9091/host/session-opener/PQ9N5YWW url IN ADDITION TO THE https://localhost:9091/user/landing/KJAHA99L link. I should be able to copy both to clipboard individually using separate copy buttons
