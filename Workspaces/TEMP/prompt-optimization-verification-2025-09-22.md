- âœ… Progressive refinement acknowledgment built-in

## ðŸš€ Key Improvements Implemented Across All Prompts

### 1. **Context-First Protocols**
All prompts now mandate reading Self-Awareness instructions and conversation history before proceeding, ensuring continuity and preventing repeated mistakes.

### 2. **Incremental Development Patterns**
Implementation must proceed in small, testable chunks with validation checkpoints rather than big-bang approaches.

### 3. **Infrastructure Validation Requirements**  
Upfront health checks (SSL, app readiness, environment) prevent late-stage failures and ghost issue chasing.

### 4. **Progressive Refinement Acknowledgment**
Elimination of binary "fixed/not fixed" claims in favor of acknowledging enhancement needs and iterative improvement.

### 5. **Evidence-Based Validation**
All operations require explicit validation evidence through actual execution, comprehensive artifacts, and measurable outcomes.

### 6. **Robust Fallback Strategies**
Critical operations require multiple approaches and graceful degradation patterns.

## ðŸ“Š Optimization Impact

### Efficiency Gains Expected:
- **Reduced Repeated Mistakes**: Context-first approach prevents revisiting solved problems
- **Faster Problem Resolution**: Infrastructure validation catches issues early
- **More Reliable Operations**: Multiple fallback strategies eliminate brittle failures  
- **Better Documentation**: Technical reasoning preserved for future reference

### Quality Improvements Expected:
- **Higher Success Rates**: Incremental approach with checkpoints increases completion rates
- **More Robust Solutions**: Fallback strategies handle edge cases and changes
- **Better Evidence Trails**: Comprehensive artifacts support debugging and validation
- **Continuous Learning**: Progressive refinement improves outcomes over time
