# NOOR Canvas Testing Workspace

This directory contains successful test files organized by issue resolution. **These test files should NOT be moved to TEMP as they represent validated testing solutions.**

## Directory Structure

### [Issue-106-Session-Creation/](Issue-106-Session-Creation/)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Issue**: [Issue-106: Host-SessionOpener Cascading Dropdown Implementation & Testing](../../IssueTracker/COMPLETED/Issue-106-Host-SessionOpener-Cascading-Dropdown-Implementation-Testing.md)

## Testing Standards

### File Organization Principles
1. **Success-Based Organization**: Test files organized by successfully resolved issues
2. **Two-Way Linking**: Each test directory includes README.md with links back to issue tracker
3. **Dedicated Locations**: No mixing with TEMP files - these are permanent reference implementations
4. **Cross-References**: Issue tracker includes links to test file locations

### Test File Categories
- **API Validation**: HTML-based test frameworks for endpoint testing
- **Authentication Testing**: PowerShell scripts for auth workflow validation  
- **UI Testing**: Playwright-based browser automation tests
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation

## Integration with Issue Tracker
All test directories maintain bidirectional links with the [Issue Tracker](../../IssueTracker/ncIssueTracker.md):
- Issue descriptions reference test file locations
- Test README files reference source issues
- Cross-references maintained for full traceability

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Reference Implementation**: Use these tests as templates for similar issue resolution
2. **Validation Framework**: Run tests to validate fixes during development  
3. **Documentation**: Each test includes comprehensive documentation of the problem solved
4. **Preservation**: These files represent successful solutions and should be preserved as reference material
