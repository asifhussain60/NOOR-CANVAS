**Usage**: Triggered by command "Run NOOR Canvas healthcheck" - executes complete systematic verification  
**Last Updated**: September 14, 2025  
**Version**: v2.0 - Enhanced with Issue Validation & Code Verification

---

**Context**: You are GitHub Copilot working on NOOR Canvas (Islamic content sharing platform) on September 14, 2025. Recent work included major issue tracker cleanup (37+ files deleted), Phase 4 preparation, and Host Dashboard elimination.

## **Recent Context (September 14, 2025)**
- **Major Cleanup**: Removed 40+ obsolete issues from Phase 1-3 that were completed
- **Phase 4 Preparation**: Host Dashboard elimination complete, branding integration ready
- **Code Quality**: Host UX streamlining implemented (direct CreateSession routing)
- **Documentation**: All implementation work consolidated in IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.MD (single source of truth)
- **Git Status**: Clean commit (3dbc420) with 37 files changed, build successful, all tests passing

## **Healthcheck Objectives**

### **1. Issue Tracker Cleanup & Validation**
**Systematically clean up obsolete issues and validate claimed fixes against actual code:**

**Required Actions**:
- **Review NC-ISSUE-TRACKER.MD**: Identify issues marked as COMPLETED but may not actually be resolved
- **Code Verification**: For each COMPLETED issue, verify the fix exists in actual codebase
- **Test Runner Validation**: Run relevant tests to confirm claimed fixes actually work
- **Status Reversion**: If fixes don't exist or don't work, move issues back to NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS
- **Remove Obsolete Issues**: Delete issue files for problems that are genuinely resolved and no longer relevant
- **Consolidate Duplicates**: Merge duplicate or overlapping issues into single tracking items

**Systematic Issue Validation Process**:
```
For each COMPLETED issue in IssueTracker/COMPLETED/:
1. Read issue description and claimed resolution from .md file
2. Identify specific code changes that should exist based on resolution
3. Use grep_search to find relevant code patterns in codebase
4. Use read_file to verify actual implementation matches claimed fix
5. Run applicable tests to confirm functionality works
6. Manual validation: Test actual behavior if automated tests unavailable

Validation Decision Matrix:
‚úÖ KEEP AS COMPLETED: Fix exists in code, functionality verified, tests pass
üîÑ REVERT TO NOT STARTED: Fix doesn't exist or doesn't work as claimed
üîÑ REVERT TO IN PROGRESS: Partial fix exists but incomplete implementation
üóëÔ∏è DELETE ISSUE: Problem genuinely resolved/obsolete, no longer relevant

Documentation Updates Required:
- Move issue files between status folders based on validation results
- Update NC-ISSUE-TRACKER.MD status icons and counts
- Add verification notes to issues that fail validation
- Update IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.MD if phase completion affected
```

**High-Priority Issues for Validation**:
- **Host Authentication Issues**: Verify authentication actually works end-to-end
- **Database Connectivity Issues**: Confirm database operations function correctly  
- **API Endpoint Issues**: Validate endpoints exist and return expected responses
- **Routing Issues**: Test actual navigation and page loading functionality
- **Build/Compilation Issues**: Verify builds succeed without claimed errors

**Code Verification Examples**:
```powershell
# Host Dashboard removal verification
grep_search -query "HostDashboard" -includePattern "**/*.razor" 
# Should return no results if properly removed

# Host authentication endpoint verification  
read_file "SPA/NoorCanvas/Controllers/HostController.cs" 1 50
# Should contain authenticate endpoint

# CreateSession HttpClient pattern verification
grep_search -query "HttpClientFactory" -includePattern "SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/CreateSession.razor"
# Should show HttpClientFactory usage if Issue-53 resolved
```

### **2. Implementation Reality Verification**
**Verify actual codebase against claimed implementations in IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.MD:**

**Required Actions**:
- **Controller Verification**: Count and validate actual controllers exist (should be 8: Admin, Annotations, Health, Host, HostProvisioner, Issue, Logs, Participant)
- **SignalR Hub Verification**: Confirm 3 hubs exist and are functional (SessionHub, AnnotationHub, QAHub)  
- **Database Schema Verification**: Validate 13 canvas tables exist and migrations applied
- **Host UX Verification**: Confirm Host Dashboard removal and direct CreateSession routing works
- **Test Coverage Verification**: Count actual test files and validate claimed 120+ test cases
- **API Endpoint Verification**: Ensure documented endpoints actually exist and return expected responses

**Code Reality Checks**:
```
‚úÖ VERIFY: Host Dashboard removed (no HostDashboard.razor)
‚úÖ VERIFY: Host.razor routes to /host/session/create?guid={guid}
‚úÖ VERIFY: HostController has no /dashboard endpoint  
‚úÖ VERIFY: CreateSession.razor uses HttpClientFactory pattern
‚úÖ VERIFY: All 8 controllers exist and compile
‚úÖ VERIFY: All 3 SignalR hubs exist and have proper methods
```

### **3. Document Alignment & Code Synchronization**
**Ensure all documentation matches actual implementation (no aspirational claims):**

**Required Actions**:
- **IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.MD Accuracy**: Update completion percentages based on verified reality
- **Phase Status Accuracy**: Ensure Phase 1-3 completion claims match actual implementation
- **Remove Aspirational Content**: Delete any documentation that describes unimplemented features
- **Consolidate All Implementation Docs**: Ensure everything is in IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.MD (single source of truth)
- **API Documentation Accuracy**: Ensure documented API endpoints match actual controller methods

### **4. Global Commands Functionality Assessment**
**Test and repair all global commands with actual verification:**

**Commands to Verify with Execution Tests**:
- **`nc -Help`** - NOOR Canvas application runner (verify help output and port management)
- **`nct -Help`** - Host token generator (verify interactive functionality)
- **`ncdoc -Help`** - Documentation server (verify DocFX site launching)
- **`iiskill -Help`** - IIS Express process killer (**KNOWN ISSUE**: Missing from PowerShell profile)

**Comprehensive Command Testing**:
```powershell
# Test each command and validate actual functionality
nc -Help        # Should display usage information
nct -Help       # Should show token generation help
ncdoc -Help     # Should show DocFX documentation help  
iiskill -Help   # Should show process killer help (likely missing)
```

**Required Fixes Based on Test Results**:
- **Fix `iiskill` global command**: Add missing function to PowerShell profile
- **Verify PowerShell profile**: Validate all 4 commands load correctly on startup
- **Test actual functionality**: Don't just check help - test real command execution
- **Update setup script**: Run `Workspaces/Global/setup-global-commands.ps1` if repairs needed

**Profile Validation & Auto-Repair**:
```powershell
# Check current profile and repair if needed
Get-Content $PROFILE | Select-String "function nc"    # Should exist
Get-Content $PROFILE | Select-String "function nct"   # Should exist  
Get-Content $PROFILE | Select-String "function ncdoc" # Should exist
Get-Content $PROFILE | Select-String "function iiskill" # Likely missing
```
