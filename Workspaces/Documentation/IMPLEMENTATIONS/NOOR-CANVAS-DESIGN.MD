---

## 0) System Tenets (Canonical Rules)
1. **GUID = Gate.** Session access is by a cryptographically-strong GUID (UUID4 128-bit). Links expire by TTL (3h default) and immediately on explicit host End/Expire actions.
2. **Host GUID Security.** Host dashboard access is protected with a distinct Host GUID (rotatable), generated by a provisioning tool. No username/password is required. The server validates the GUID (hashed) against `canvas.HostSessions` and issues a short-lived session for dashboard usage.
3. **Registration Required by Default.** Collect Name / City / Country for roster/analytics; default is required but configurable per deployment. User data persists via a `UserId` across sessions within the same Album.
4. **Self‑Contained Styling.** NOOR bundles required CSS for Quran/Hadith/Etymology/Poetry; no runtime dependency on KSESSIONS CSS. Image references resolve to environment-specific roots (DEV/PROD).
5. **Read‑Only Transcript Rendering.** Session transcript HTML is rendered in a sandboxed, read-only container; interaction overlays (share, annotations) are layered on top.
6. **Realtime First.** SignalR is authoritative for session state, deltas (assets, Q&A, annotations); late-joiners reconcile via authoritative snapshots.
7. **Performance Priority.** Target low-latency asset share delivery (P95 < 200ms) and predictable scaling patterns.
8. **Privacy-Conscious Q&A.** Questions are anonymous to participants; hosts and admins may view registration metadata for moderation only.
9. **Observability by Default.** The Noor Observer and Issue Tracker are included in Phase 1 for diagnostics and triage.

---

## 1) Configuration Notes
- **Frontend Framework**: Blazor Server for better ASP.NET Core integration and IIS hosting.
- **Session Management**: 3h default expiry, one active GUID link per session, registration required by default.
- **Performance**: Target 100 concurrent users per session, moderate rate limiting, standard audit logging.
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers only (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+).
- **Environment Strategy**: Simple Dev → Production (2-tier deployment).
- **Scaling**: Start simple, add Redis backplane in Phase 5 if performance testing shows need.
- **Analytics**: Standard engagement metrics collection (session participation, Q&A usage).
- **Data Protection**: Session data is ephemeral. User profiles are retained for cross-session access within an Album.
- **Internationalization**: English + Arabic interface support.
- `appsettings.Development.json` enables all Observer features and SignalR diagnostics.
- Production disables sensitive logs; PII scrub; retention policies.
- Environment mapping for image roots (DEV/PROD) via configuration.

## 3) Unified Use Cases (Authoritative)
This section enumerates the primary and secondary use cases for NOOR Canvas. Each use case includes actor, preconditions, trigger, main flow, alternatives, and success criteria. The server is authoritative for session state, Q&A ordering (VoteCount desc, queuedAt asc), and security checks.

Host / Session Management

UC-H1 Create/Select Session
- Primary actor: Host
- Preconditions: Host authenticated and redirected to Session Management View.
- Trigger: Host navigates through Album → Category → Session selection.
- Main flow: Host selects Album from dropdown → Category dropdown filters by Album → Session dropdown filters by Category → Host clicks "Generate Session Token" → system generates SessionId + public user GUID link → Host receives shareable user URL and session controls.
- Alternative: If generation fails (rate limit, DB error) show error and retry. Host can select different Album/Category/Session combinations.
- Success: Session link generated, Host has shareable URL for participants and can proceed to start the session.

UC-H2 Begin Session (Go Live)
- Primary actor: Host
- Preconditions: Session created, users may be in Waiting Room.
- Trigger: Host clicks "Begin Session".
- Main flow: Host requests begin → server marks session Live, sets StartedAt → SessionHub broadcasts SessionBegan to group → clients auto-navigate to Canvas View.
- Alternative: If Host GUID invalid, reject; if already Live, no-op.
- Success: Session Live, participants moved to canvas, audit logged.

UC-H3 End / Expire Session
- Primary actor: Host or system TTL.
- Preconditions: Session Live or active link.
- Trigger: Host clicks "End" or TTL expires.
- Main flow: Host or system marks session EndedAt and expires links → SessionHub broadcasts SessionEnded → Host GUID invalidated for dashboard access.
- Alternative: Immediate expiry by Host; rollback not allowed.
- Success: Session closed, users moved to post-session view, audit recorded.

UC-H4 Generate/Expire Secondary Links
- Primary actor: Host
- Preconditions: Active session.
- Trigger: Host requests new share link or expires an existing link.
- Main flow: Server issues new SessionLinks entries (GUID) or sets ExpiresAt/State → changes reflected in dashboard and distributed to roster.
- Success: Links updated and logged.
 
Authentication (Landing & Role Selection)

Both Hosts and Users start at a single NOOR Canvas landing/login page with basic info about the site. The page presents two primary buttons: "I am the Host" and "I am a User". Clicking either button prompts for the session GUID. The flow then diverges:

- Host flow: The user selects "I am the Host" and enters the Host GUID provisioned earlier by the `Tools/HostProvisioner`. The client POSTs the GUID to `POST /api/auth/validate-guid` for server-side validation. If the token is not provided, or is wrong, invalid, or expired, an error message is displayed. On success, the server issues a short-lived auth cookie or JWT and redirects **directly to the Session Management View** (not a dashboard). The server loads Album/Category/Session metadata in real-time from `KSESSIONS` tables to populate cascading dropdowns. The host selects Album → Category → Session, then generates user session tokens and starts the session directly from this interface.

- User flow: The user selects "I am a User" and enters the GUID.
- **New Flow:** The client first checks `localStorage` for a previously saved `UserId`.
	- **If a `UserId` exists**, the client sends it to the server with the session GUID. The server validates the GUID and looks up the user profile. The user is then placed directly in the Waiting Room.
	- **If no `UserId` exists**, the user is shown the Registration page. On submit, a new `UserId` is generated, the user profile is stored server-side, and the `UserId` is saved to `localStorage` for future convenience. The client then enters the Waiting Room.

- Notes:
- The Host GUID is a secret and is stored hashed in `canvas.HostSessions` for audit and rotation.
- Reading Groups/Categories/Sessions live from `KSESSIONS` ensures the Host Console selectors always reflect canonical server data.
- An "Album" (GroupName) is the main topic and can comprise multiple sessions, often with the same users.

- Main flow: System compiles transcript (HTML/ sanitized), attachments, Q&A history, annotations → provide download link or send to configured storage.
- Success: Export created and accessible.

Notes
- Each server-side state change must be audited. Q&A ordering is authoritative on the server and clients must reconcile optimistic updates using snapshot/reconciliation flows.
- Privacy: Questions are anonymous to users; hosts/admins may see registration metadata for moderation only. All actions respect PII policies in config.
- **User Data Retention:** User-specific information is only valid for the duration of a session, but a persistent `UserId` will be used to remember users across multiple sessions within the same Album.

## 5) Host Authentication Strategy (Security Implementation)
Two-Token System Design
User GUID (Public): For participants to join sessions - /s/{userGuid}

Host GUID (Private): For host dashboard access - /host/dashboard/{sessionId}?guid={hostGuid}

Host Authentication Flow
Session Creation:

Host creates session via API or interface

System generates:

Public GUID link for users

Host GUID

The Host Provisioner Tool is used to generate a unique Host GUID and store its hash in canvas.HostSessions.

The host is given the plaintext Host GUID to use for authentication on the /host landing page.

Host Access (GUID + sliding-expiration session):

Host navigates to /host landing page and provides the Host GUID.

The client POSTs the GUID to POST /api/auth/validate-guid for server-side validation.

On success, the server validates the GUID (compare hashed GUID to canvas.HostSessions.HostGuidHash) and verifies the mapped SessionId is active.

The server then issues a secure, httpOnly session cookie scoped to the Host dashboard.

The cookie has a sliding expiration policy: on activity, its expiration is extended up to an absolute max session lifetime.

Privileged endpoints and SignalR hub operations validate the session cookie and check canvas.HostSessions for an active state.

Revocation: setting IsActive=false or populating RevokedAt immediately denies further host actions.

Security notes:

Store Host GUIDs hashed (HMAC-SHA256 using an app secret) in HostGuidHash.

Issue cookies with Secure, httpOnly, SameSite=Strict and Path=/host. Use HTTPS only.

Rate-limit POST /api/auth/validate-guid to prevent brute-force GUID attempts.

## 6) API & Hub Contracts (TypeScript/C# friendly)

## 7) Frontend Implementation Map
7.0 UI/UX Design Principles
Design Philosophy: Clean, centralized layouts with balanced visual hierarchy and generous spacing for enhanced clarity.

Universal Design Standards
Responsive Design: Desktop, iPad, mobile.

Centralized Layouts: Content centered with balanced margins.

Clean Aesthetics: Simple, uncluttered.

Spacing Strategy: Generous whitespace.

Typography: Readable fonts with suitable line-height.

Color Palette: Minimal, Islamic design sensibilities.

7.1 Host Session Management (Direct Action Interface)
Target Devices: Desktop and iPad only - hosts do not run sessions from mobile phones.
Layout Strategy: **Action-first interface** - no dashboard, direct session management workflow.

**NEW Components & Behavior (HOST EXCLUSIVE)**

**Session Selection Panel:** Cascading dropdowns (Album → Category → Session) populated from KSESSIONS data.

**Token Generation:** "Generate Session Token" button creates shareable user access link.

**Session Controls:** "Start Session" button to go live, with session status indicators.

**Live Session Management:** Once session starts, interface transforms to show:
- TranscriptPanel: Read-only DIV mount with AssetDetector overlays
- Q&A Queue: Live updating list with keyboard shortcuts  
- Roster Panel: Collapsible sidebar showing participants
- Session Controls: End/Pause/Extend controls
- Observer Dock: Toggleable diagnostic overlay

**Zoom Integration Panel:** Embedded iframe for Zoom (when session is live).

**Key UX Change:** Host bypasses traditional dashboard entirely and goes straight to actionable session management interface.

7.0.1 Landing & Authentication UX
Single landing/login page with two buttons: "I am the Host" and "I am a User".

Both flows ask for a session GUID.

**Host flow (UPDATED):** enter Host GUID, validate, and redirect **directly to Session Management View** (not dashboard).

User flow: check localStorage for UserId. If not found, show the Registration page.

After successful user registration, persist the generated UserId, Name, City, and Country to localStorage.

7.2 User Canvas (Participant View)
Layout Strategy: Immersive, distraction-free content consumption with optional interaction panels.

Components & Behavior

WaitingRoom: Lobby with session preview and auto-navigation on SessionBegan.

CanvasView: Centralized asset display with transitions.

QAPanel: Slide-out panel for asking questions (280 char limit).

QAPanel: The question list supports upvoting; items are sorted by VoteCount desc, then queued time asc. Users see anonymous counts; hosts see voter metadata for moderation.

LateJoinSync: Reconcile via /state then real-time subscribe.

7.3 Responsive Design Strategy
Desktop (1024px+): Host two-column layout; user centered content (max 800px).

Tablet (768-1023px): Host iPad optimizations; touch-friendly.

Mobile (<768px): Users only; single column.

7.4 Styling & Theming
McBeatch base + /styles/noor/ modules (noor-ayah.css, noor-hadith.css, noor-etymology.css, noor-poetry.css, noor-canvas.css, noor-annotations.css).

Bundle Arabic fonts (Amiri, Noto).

Image paths: DEV and PROD mapping via config.

7.5 Asset Detection Implementation
Supported content types (Verse, Ayah, Hadith, Etymology, Poetry, Images, Quotes) mapped to CSS selectors and processed accordingly. AssetDetector component overlays Share buttons and emits share payloads to the SessionHub.

Performance optimizations: virtual scrolling, asset caching, debounced updates, intersection observer, CSS containment.

7.6 Component Standards & Library Recommendations
To keep the UI consistent, accessible, and maintainable we standardize a small set of reusable components (dialogs, drawers, toasts, lists, buttons, overlays, etc.) and wrap a single chosen UI library behind lightweight app-specific wrappers.

Contract (tiny):

Inputs: clearly typed props (data, visible, loading, ariaLabel, rtl).

Outputs: events for confirm/cancel/close/submit and lifecycle hooks (opened, closed).

Error modes: validation messages, disabled states, network errors.

Success criteria: keyboard focus management, screen-reader announcements, responsive behavior.

Required standard components (implement app wrappers and test harnesses):

Modal / Dialog (confirm, form, details) — supports title, aria descriptions, focus trap, Escape to close

Confirm dialog — small, blocking confirm with customizable CTA/Cancel

Toast / Snackbar — non-blocking feedback with types (info, success, warn, error)

Drawer / Slide-over — right/left dockable drawer for Q&A, Roster, Host controls

Panel / Card — consistent content container with header/footer slots

List / VirtualizedList — sortable (server/client) and supports stable keys for reorder (used for Q&A and asset lists)

Inline Popover / Tooltip — small contextual helpers for assets and annotations

Badge / Pill — for counts (votes, unread)

Button / IconButton — primary/secondary/ghost variants + accessible labels

Toggle / Switch / Checkbox / Radio — form primitives

Overlay / AssetOverlay — share buttons and asset controls mounted inside read-only transcript

Annotation toolbar — compact, keyboard-accessible tool palette

Behavioral rules

Default ordering for Q&A lists: by VoteCount desc then queuedAt asc (server canonical). UI must reflect server ordering and optimistically update on Vote events, reconciling on snapshot.

All interactive components must support keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes; test with axe/Pa11y in CI.

Components must be themable via CSS variables (design tokens) and support RTL switching.

Testing and docs

Create a small component gallery/demo page (Blazor host page) to exercise each component visually and with keyboard-only flows.

Unit test behavioral contracts (focus trap, open/close, confirm/cancel) and a small E2E smoke test for the Q&A voting flow.

Library recommendations (Blazor-first)

MudBlazor (MIT, rich, theming, good accessibility) — recommended primary choice for open-source projects.

Radzen.Blazor (MIT, solid set of components) — lightweight alternative.

MatBlazor (MIT) — material design components for Blazor.

Telerik UI for Blazor / Syncfusion Blazor (commercial) — if budget allows and you want enterprise support & richer components.

JS/CSS library fallbacks (if parts remain JS-driven)

Headless UI / Radix (unopinionated primitives) + Tailwind for utility styling.

Bootstrap (v5) — for consistent baseline styles; integrates easily with Blazor via BlazorStrap.

SweetAlert2 or Toastify for lightweight modals/toasts (only for small JS-only flows).

Recommendation & next step

Pick one primary Blazor library (MudBlazor recommended). Create an internal Noor.UI wrapper project that exposes only the app contracts above (DialogService, ToastService, DrawerService, List components). Implement a small component gallery page and a migration guide for McBeatch styles to map to design tokens.

This standardization keeps the host and user canvases visually consistent, simplifies accessibility audits, and makes future theme or platform swaps straightforward.

8) Security Model
Access: GUID-only; validate link state.

Expiry: TTL + host-triggered end.

Registration: metadata-only; privacy-preserving storage.

Rate limits: join/ask/vote.

Voting is rate-limited per-registration/IP: default 1 vote action per 5s, burst up to 3; server enforces idempotent votes and rejects rapid toggles.

Sanitization: server-side HTML sanitization; no inline scripts.

Hub Authorization: scoped to sessionId & role.

Vote actions are scoped to a registration or lightweight client token to prevent vote stuffing; server validates uniqueness and enforces rate limits.

9) Noor Observer & Issue Tracker (Phase 1 deliverable)
Noor Observer: Serilog, health checks, client diagnostics, /observer/stream for dev; Observer dock toggled with ?debug=1.
Issue Tracker: POST /issues stores issues to canvas.Issues; simple admin triage view and create-from-log functionality.

10) Phased Implementation Plan (authoritative)

### Directory Structure
- **Main Application**: `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA` - Main NOOR Canvas ASP.NET Core 8 Blazor Server application
- **Helper Tools**: `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\Tools` - All console applications and utilities
- **Issue Tracker**: `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\IssueTracker` - Main NC-ISSUE-TRACKER.MD file with organized subfolders by status

Phase 1 — Skeleton, Observer, Issue Tracker, DB (Weeks 1–3): repo init, core projects, /healthz, Serilog, Observer stream, DB migrations (including new Users table), McBeatch wiring, hubs, unit tests, IIS launch profile.

Add: Create console applications as part of initial skeletal phases. Console apps to scaffold in Phase 1 include:
- `Tools/HostProvisioner` (generate Host GUIDs, persist host session hashes)
- `Tools/DbMigrator` (apply migrations, seed minimal data, rollback helpers)
- `Tools/ObserverCli` (connect to /observer/stream for dev diagnostics)
- `Tools/IssueUploader` (batch upload issues / import issues from logs)
- `Tools/MigrationHelper` (backfill Host GUIDs from legacy KSESSIONS data)

These console apps should be small .NET 8 console projects (templated) with clear command interfaces, logging, and a `--dry-run` option. Include minimal unit tests where practical.

Phase 2 — Host & Participant Core (Weeks 4–8): **Host Session Management Interface** (Album/Category/Session cascading dropdowns, token generation, direct session start), Registration (with persistent UserId lookup), Waiting Room, read-only transcript mount, Asset Detector & Share, User Canvas, Q&A.

Phase 3 — Annotations & Admin (Weeks 9–12): SVG overlay tools, sync throttling, roster admin, Redis backplane.

Phase 3.5 — Mock-to-Live Data Integration (Weeks 12.5–13): Intensive integration of live API calls, SignalR broadcasting, and real KSESSIONS data.

Phase 4 — Styling & Content Integration (Weeks 13–15): Full CSS replication, font bundling, image path resolution, share overlay polish.

Phase 5 — Performance & Accessibility (Weeks 16–18): Perf budgets, caching, WCAG 2.2 AA, telemetry.

Phase 6 — Testing & Deployment (Weeks 19–20): Automated tests, load testing, deployment.

11) Next Steps & Notes
This NOOR-CANVAS-DESIGN-FINAL.MD consolidates the V3 and original design docs, deduplicates overlapping sections, and includes the requested configuration and tenets blocks.

**MAJOR UX CHANGE (September 11, 2025):** Host authentication now redirects directly to Session Management Interface instead of a traditional dashboard. Hosts select Album → Category → Session via cascading dropdowns, generate user access tokens, and start sessions directly from this action-oriented interface. This change is tracked in Issue-17 and affects Phase 2 implementation priorities.

The Host Provisioner Tool will generate a cryptographically-strong Host GUID and store a hash in canvas.HostSessions. The plaintext GUID is then provided to the host for login.

Usage & migration notes:

The tool is intended for initial provisioning and emergency host setup. For production, integrate this flow into an admin UI or provisioning API and use a secure app secret for hashing rather than the DB connection string.

Backfill strategy: use the tool or a migration script to migrate existing host tokens from KSESSIONS.Sessions into canvas.HostSessions while storing only token hashes and rotating secrets. (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

## Appendix A — Console Application Contracts (Phase 1 deliverable)
Each console app is a tiny .NET 8 console project with a consistent CLI contract (System.CommandLine or McMaster.Extensions.CommandLineUtils). Keep them simple, testable, and idempotent.

**Location**: All console applications are located under `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\Tools`

- 1) Tools/HostProvisioner
- Purpose: Generate Host GUIDs, HMAC-SHA256 them with an app secret, and persist to `canvas.HostSessions`.
- Commands:
	- `host-provisioner create --session-id 123 --created-by "ops@org" --expires "2025-12-01"` => prints plaintext GUID and optionally copies to clipboard.
	- `host-provisioner rotate --host-session-id 456` => generates new GUID, stores new hash, revokes old.
	- `--dry-run` option for all commands.

- 2) Tools/DbMigrator
- Purpose: Apply EF Core or SQL migrations, seed basic data (admin account, test sessions), and provide rollback helpers.
- Commands: `db-migrator apply`, `db-migrator rollback --to 20250901_01`, `db-migrator seed --env dev`.

- 3) Tools/ObserverCli
- Purpose: Connect to `/observer/stream`, allow interactive filtering, and capture snapshots to disk for triage.

4) Tools/IssueUploader
- Purpose: Batch import issues from JSON/CSV files into `canvas.Issues` and optionally attach session snapshots.

5) Tools/MigrationHelper
- Purpose: Import host tokens from legacy stores (KSESSIONS) into `canvas.HostSessions` with proper hashing and optional rotation.

Implementation notes for console apps
- Language: .NET 8 (C#) console templates.
- Logging: Serilog with console and file sinks.
- Security: Respect `--dry-run` as default unless `--force` is provided for destructive operations.
- Tests: Unit-test core helpers (hashing, SQL scripts) and an integration smoke test that runs against a local dev database.

## Appendix B — Lightweight Contract / API Examples
Provide minimal TypeScript definitions for the API surface and SignalR contracts in `src/contracts` and `tools/clients` to help front-end teams scaffold quickly.

Example: minimal Question model (TypeScript)
```ts
export interface QuestionDto {
	questionId: number;
	sessionId: number;
	body: string;
	voteCount: number;
	queuedAt: string; // ISO
	status: 'Queued'|'Selected'|'Answered'|'Hidden';
}
```

Example: Snapshot response
```ts
export interface SessionSnapshot {
	sessionId: number;
	status: 'Waiting'|'Live'|'Ended';
	currentAsset?: any;
	qna: QuestionDto[];
	roster: { registrationId: number; userId: string; name?: string }[];
}
```

## Quality Gates (build/lint/tests)
- Build: dotnet build solution with Release configuration (no breaking errors)
- Lint/Formatting: dotnet-format or EditorConfig enforced in CI
- Unit tests: xUnit/NUnit with a small set of fast-running unit tests added in Phase 1 for core helpers (hashing, GUID validation, simple repo mocks)
- Smoke test: run `tools/db-migrator --env dev` then start the app in IIS Express/ kestrel profile and call `/healthz`.

## Try-it / Quickstart (developer)
1. Clone repo
2. Start local SQL Server (or use LocalDB)
3. Run `Tools/DbMigrator apply --env dev` to create schema and seed data.
4. Run the main application from `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA` in VS (IIS Express or Kestrel) and open `/`.

## Completion Summary
- File: `Workspaces/Documentation/IMPLEMENTATIONS/NOOR-CANVAS-DESIGN.MD` updated with full v3.0 FINAL design including Console Applications added to Architecture and Phase 1.
- Verification: Document saved to workspace. No build or code changes performed here — the document describes the next code steps and includes console apps and tooling plans.

Requirements coverage: All requested sections and details are included; Console app creation is explicitly added to Phase 1 and Architecture (Done).
