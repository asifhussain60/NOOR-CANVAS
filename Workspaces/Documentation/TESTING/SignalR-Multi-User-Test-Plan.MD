# SignalR Multi-User Testing Strategy - NOOR Canvas v3.0

**Project**: NOOR Canvas Real-Time Collaboration Validation  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test plan to prove SignalR multi-user functionality with bidirectional communication  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

---

## üìã **TEST PLAN OVERVIEW**

### **üéØ PRIMARY OBJECTIVES**
1. **Multi-User Token Sharing**: Validate multiple users can join sessions using the same host-generated token
2. **Bidirectional Communication**: Prove real-time data flows between host ‚Üî users and user ‚Üî user  
3. **Asset Sharing**: Confirm drawing annotations and Q&A content synchronize across all participants
4. **Connection Resilience**: Test SignalR connection recovery and participant management under various scenarios
5. **Production Readiness**: Validate system handles concurrent users with enterprise-grade performance

### **üóÑÔ∏è SIGNALR INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
**Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, NOOR Canvas has full SignalR implementation:**

#### **‚úÖ Hub Architecture (Production Ready)**
- **SessionHub** (`/hub/session`): Session lifecycle, participant join/leave, status updates
- **AnnotationHub** (`/hub/annotation`): Real-time drawing synchronization, canvas collaboration  
- **QAHub** (`/hub/qa`): Q&A system, question/answer broadcasting, participant interaction

#### **‚úÖ Group Management System**
- **Pattern**: `"Session_{sessionId}"` for participant grouping
- **Functionality**: Automatic group assignment, broadcast to group members only
- **Isolation**: Sessions remain separate, no cross-session data leakage

#### **‚úÖ Connection Lifecycle Management**
- **OnConnectedAsync**: Participant tracking, logging, group assignment
- **OnDisconnectedAsync**: Cleanup, participant removal, status updates
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection with state preservation

#### **‚úÖ Real-Time Features Confirmed**
- **Participant Tracking**: Live participant count, join/leave notifications
- **Annotation Broadcasting**: Drawing events synchronized across all participants
- **Q&A System**: Real-time question submission, answer broadcasting
- **Session Status Updates**: Host-initiated session state changes propagated instantly
