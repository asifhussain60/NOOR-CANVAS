# Agent Documentation Directory

This directory contains all documentation generated by AI agents working on the NOOR CANVAS project.

## Directory Structure

```
_DOCS/
├── README.md               # This file
├── summaries/              # Work completion summaries
├── analysis/               # Technical analysis documents

└── migrations/             # Migration and reorganization docs
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Agents
- **NEVER** create documentation files in the project root
- **ALWAYS** place analysis and summary files in the appropriate subdirectory
- Use descriptive filenames with dates when relevant
- Follow the naming convention: `DESCRIPTION-SUMMARY.md` or `DESCRIPTION-ANALYSIS.md`

### Directory Purposes

#### `/summaries/`
- Work completion summaries
- Sprint retrospectives
- Progress reports
- Task completion documentation

#### `/analysis/`
- Technical analysis documents
- Architecture reviews
- Performance analysis
- Code quality assessments

#### `/configs/`
- Configuration file documentation
- Setup guides
- Configuration migration reports
- Environment setup instructions

#### `/migrations/`
- Database migration reports
- Code migration documentation
- File reorganization summaries
- Upgrade and refactoring reports

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include date for time-sensitive documents: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- Use descriptive names that indicate content and purpose
- Examples:
  - `config-reorganization-summary.md`
  - `2025-09-27-migration-report.md`
  - `eslint-configuration-analysis.md`

## Maintenance

This directory should be cleaned periodically to remove outdated documentation. Archive important historical documents rather than deleting them.
