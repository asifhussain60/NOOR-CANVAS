# Playwright Configuration Fix - September 30, 2025

## Issue Resolved
**Problem:** Playwright tests in `Workspaces/TEMP/` directory were not being found by the test runner
**Error:** "No tests found" when running tests from temporary workspace directory
**Root Cause:** `testDir` configuration pointed only to `PlayWright/tests`, excluding `Workspaces/TEMP/`

## SelfAwareness Compliance
According to `.github/instructions/SelfAwareness.instructions.md`:
- **Line 40:** "Create headless, silent Playwright test in `Workspaces/TEMP/`"
- **Line 49:** "All phase tests go in `Workspaces/TEMP/` directory"

The configuration needed to support both standard and temporary test locations.

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified: `config/testing/playwright.config.cjs`

**Before:**
```javascript
const cfg = {
    timeout: 30 * 1000,
    testDir: '../../PlayWright/tests',
    // ...
```

**After:**
```javascript
const cfg = {
    timeout: 30 * 1000,
    testDir: '../../',
    testMatch: ['**/PlayWright/tests/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', '**/Workspaces/TEMP/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
    // ...
```

### Key Changes
1. **testDir:** Changed from specific `'../../PlayWright/tests'` to root `'../../'`
2. **testMatch:** Added pattern array supporting both:
   - Standard tests: `**/PlayWright/tests/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`
   - Temporary tests: `**/Workspaces/TEMP/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`

## Validation Results

### ✅ TEMP Directory Support
```bash
npx playwright test Workspaces/TEMP/retrosync-comprehensive-audit-093025.spec.ts --config=config/testing/playwright.config.cjs
```
**Result:** Successfully found and executed 5 tests from TEMP directory

### ✅ PlayWright Directory Support  
```bash
npx playwright test --config=config/testing/playwright.config.cjs --list
```
**Result:** Successfully found tests in PlayWright/tests (with expected architectural errors)

## Architectural Integration

This fix enables the SelfAwareness phase-based testing workflow:
1. **Phase Implementation** → Code changes
2. **Phase Testing** → Auto-generate test in `Workspaces/TEMP/`  
3. **Phase Validation** → Execute test to verify changes
4. **Phase Completion** → Move to next phase

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impact
- ✅ Enables temporary test execution per SelfAwareness protocol
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing PlayWright tests
- ✅ Supports phase-based development workflows
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing configurations

### No Negative Impact
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Performance impact negligible (pattern-based matching)
- ✅ No changes to other configuration modes (standalone, temp)

## Future Maintenance

The configuration is now aligned with the SelfAwareness instruction requirements. Any future modifications should preserve support for both:
- `PlayWright/tests/**` - Permanent test suite
- `Workspaces/TEMP/**` - Temporary phase tests
