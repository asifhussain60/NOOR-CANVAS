# Waitingroom - NC Package Restore Fix

**Key**: waitingroom  
**Mode**: apply  
**Debug Level**: simple  
**Run ID**: 0928-1141  
**Date**: September 28, 2025

## Issue Identified
User reported: "Why does this keep happening??? Identify discrepancies from screenshot"

**Root Cause**: `nc.ps1` was performing package restore via `dotnet run` when it should only launch the application. Only `ncb.ps1` should handle package restoration as part of its build process.

## Discrepancy Analysis
- **Expected Behavior**: 
  - `ncb.ps1`: Build (with restore) + Launch 
  - `nc.ps1`: Launch only (no restore)
- **Actual Behavior**: Both scripts were doing restore
- **Impact**: Unnecessary package restore operations and potential conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified
`d:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\Workspaces\Global\nc.ps1`

### Change Made
**Before:**
```powershell
# Launch the ASP.NET Core application
dotnet run --urls "$httpsUrl;$httpUrl"
```

**After:**
```powershell
# Launch the ASP.NET Core application (no restore - ncb handles that)
dotnet run --no-restore --urls "$httpsUrl;$httpUrl"
```

## Validation Results

### Build & Launch Testing
✅ **ncb.ps1**: Successfully does restore and build, then launches via nc.ps1  
✅ **nc.ps1**: Successfully launches without restore when packages are already restored  
✅ **Application**: Starts properly on both http://localhost:9090 and https://localhost:9091  

### Terminal Evidence
```
Building NOOR Canvas application...
Restore complete (0.4s)
  NoorCanvas succeeded (7.5s) → bin\Release\net8.0\NoorCanvas.dll
Build succeeded in 8.8s
Build completed successfully!
Launching ASP.NET Core application with Kestrel...
```

### Quality Gates
✅ No compilation errors  
✅ Application starts successfully  
✅ No breaking changes to existing workflows  

## Workflow Impact

### Development Workflow
- **First Time/Clean**: Use `ncb` (builds + restores + launches)
- **Subsequent Runs**: Use `nc` (launches only, faster startup)
- **CI/CD**: No impact, both scripts work as expected

### Performance Improvement
- `nc.ps1` now launches faster (skips restore step)
- Clear separation of responsibilities between scripts
- Eliminates duplicate restore operations

## Files Changed
1. `d:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\Workspaces\Global\nc.ps1` - Added `--no-restore` flag

## Completion Status
✅ **Issue Resolved**: Package restore discrepancy fixed  
✅ **Scripts Working**: Both ncb and nc function properly  
✅ **Application Running**: NOOR Canvas launches successfully  
✅ **Quality Gates**: All validations passed  

**Status**: Ready for use
