These should not exist in production, therefore ensure configurability. This debug panel should have a button saying 'Enter Test Data'. When clicked, depending on which razor view the user is on, the button should enter the correct information. On #file:UserLanding.razor - clicking the button should Enter a test name, email and pick a random country from the dropdown. Create test data using superhero names. I want you to randomly choose data rather than showing the same data evertime.",
