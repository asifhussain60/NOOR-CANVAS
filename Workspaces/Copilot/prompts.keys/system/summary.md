# System Key Summary

**Key**: `system`
**Status**: In Progress
**Agent**: task
**Created**: 2025-09-30

## Task Summary
Updated Playwright testing infrastructure with consolidated canonical test data and proven patterns.

## Changes Made
1. **PlaywrightConfig.MD**: Added mandatory instruction to read PlaywrightTestPaths.MD
2. **PlaywrightTestPaths.MD**: Created comprehensive canonical test data reference with proven working patterns
3. **pwtest.prompt.md**: Enhanced with canonical test data section and test reliability guidelines

## Canonical Test Data Established
- Session ID: 212 (proven working)
- Host Token: PQ9N5YWW (working host control panel access)
- User Token: KJAHA99L (working participant access) 
- Base URL: https://localhost:9091
- API endpoints with expected response structures
- Database schema references (AssetLookup, SessionTranscripts)

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Phase 1: Updated PlaywrightConfig.MD with mandatory read instruction
- ✅ Phase 2: Analyzed thread for testing patterns and extracted successful data
- ✅ Phase 3: Updated pwtest.prompt.md with canonical test data reference  
- ✅ Phase 4: Created testing reference guide with standard tokens and APIs
- ✅ Phase 5: Updated Playwright tests section to reference canonical data
- ✅ Validation: Build succeeded with zero errors

## Next Steps
- Tests should now use Session 212 and Host Token PQ9N5YWW by default
- All new Playwright test creation should reference PlaywrightTestPaths.MD first
- Agents should avoid known failing patterns documented in the reference
