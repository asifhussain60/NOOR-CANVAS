# Submit Bug Fix Summary

**Key**: `submit-bug`
**Status**: complete
**Agent**: task
**Created**: 2025-10-01

## Task Summary
Fixed submit button in SessionCanvas.razor that was refreshing the page instead of broadcasting questions to HostControlPanel.

## Problem Resolved
The submit button was causing page refresh due to missing `type="button"` attribute. HTML buttons default to `type="submit"` which triggers form submission behavior.

## Changes Made
1. **Submit Button Fix**: Added `type="button"` attribute to prevent form submission
   - File: `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/SessionCanvas.razor` (line ~200)
   - Change: Added `type="button"` to button element with `@onclick="SubmitQuestion"`

2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to SubmitQuestion method
   - File: `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/SessionCanvas.razor` (lines 930-986)
   - Added `[DEBUG-WORKITEM:submit-bug]` markers throughout method
   - Enhanced request ID tracking and API response logging

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Phase 1: Fixed button type and added comprehensive logging
- ✅ Build: Successful with zero errors and warnings
- ✅ Validation: Static code validation confirmed correct implementation

## Expected Behavior
- Submit button no longer refreshes page
- Questions properly submitted via `/api/Question/Submit` API
- Questions broadcast correctly to HostControlPanel Q&A section
- Detailed logging available for debugging session flows

## Files Modified
- `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/SessionCanvas.razor`

## Validation Results
- ✅ Button has `type="button"` attribute
- ✅ `@onclick="SubmitQuestion"` handler preserved
- ✅ Try-catch error handling maintained
- ✅ Debug logging markers implemented
- ✅ Build successful with no issues
