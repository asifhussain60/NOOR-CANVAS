    "summary": "Successfully fixed HTML broadcasting by aligning with working SimpleSignalRTest pattern. Root cause: HostControlPanel was calling non-existent BroadcastHtmlContent method in SessionHub. Solution: Added BroadcastHtml method to SessionHub, updated HostControlPanel to use correct method signature, updated SessionCanvas to handle HtmlContentReceived event. This eliminates the 'appendChild Invalid or unexpected token' errors by using proven working SignalR pattern. Application builds and launches successfully."
