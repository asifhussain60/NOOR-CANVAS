# Cleanup-hub.md

## Actions Taken

### Analysis Completed
- [x] Reviewed original _KSESSIONS SignalR implementation
- [x] Analyzed current NOOR Canvas SignalR architecture  
- [x] Identified key differences and issues
- [x] Created comprehensive recommendation document

### Environment Setup
- [x] Created development environment file: `Workspaces/copilot/config/environments/dev/.env.dev`
- [x] Successfully started NOOR Canvas application on `https://localhost:9091`
- [x] Verified SignalR hub configuration at `/hub/session`

### Documentation Created
- [x] Requirements document: `Workspaces/copilot/state/hub/Requirements-hub.md`
- [x] Comprehensive recommendation: `Workspaces/copilot/state/hub/SignalR-Hub-Recommendation.md`

### Key Findings
1. **Current Implementation Status**: TestShareAsset method in HostControlPanel.razor is already functional
2. **SignalR Hub**: SessionHub.cs is well-implemented and doesn't need changes
3. **Main Issue**: Complex content processing in SessionCanvas.razor causing appendChild errors
4. **Original Pattern**: _KSESSIONS had robust connection management and simple data flow

### Recommendations Summary
- **Phase 1**: Simplify SessionCanvas AssetShared event handler
- **Phase 2**: Add connection resilience from original _KSESSIONS patterns  
- **Phase 3**: Optional database persistence and enhanced features

### Terminal Evidence
```
[15:54:49 INF]  NOOR-SIGNALR: SignalR hubs mapped - SessionHub (/hub/session), QAHub (/hub/qa), AnnotationHub (/hub/annotation), TestHub (/hub/test) {}
[15:54:49 INF] Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime Now listening on: https://localhost:9091 {}
[15:54:49 INF] Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down. {}
