# HostCanvas Debug Test Plan

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Debug panels implemented on both views
- ‚úÖ SignalR connections established (different ConnectionIds - EXPECTED)
- ‚úÖ Both connections join session_212 group successfully
- ‚úÖ Application builds and runs without warnings

## Test Scenario: Asset Sharing Flow

### Step 1: Verify Group Membership
1. **Host Panel**: Shows `session_212` and `host_212` groups
2. **User Panel**: Shows `session_212` group
3. **Both should have "Connected" status**

### Step 2: Test Asset Sharing
1. **On Host Panel**: Click "Test Share Asset" button
2. **Expected Debug Logs**:
   ```
   [Host Panel] INFO: üì§ TestShareAsset clicked - sending test asset
   [Host Panel] SUCCESS: ‚úÖ ShareAsset completed successfully
   [User Panel] SUCCESS: ‚úÖ AssetShared event received: TestContent
   [User Panel] INFO: üì• Processing HTML content: [content preview]
   ```

### Step 3: Identify Failure Point
If JavaScript error still occurs, debug logs will show exactly where:
- ‚úÖ **SignalR Transmission**: Should succeed (proven by different ConnectionIds working)
- ‚ùå **DOM Rendering**: Should show appendChild error location
- üîç **Content Analysis**: Will show problematic HTML content

## Expected Results
The debug panels should trace the complete flow and isolate the remaining appendChild issue to specific HTML content or DOM manipulation code.

## Next Actions After Test
1. Run the test scenario above
2. Analyze debug log output to pinpoint exact error location
3. Fix the specific DOM manipulation causing the appendChild error
4. Remove debug logging and close the workitem
