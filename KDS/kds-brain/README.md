## 🎯 What is BRAIN?

BRAIN is KDS's **self-learning feedback system** that captures knowledge from every interaction and uses it to make smarter decisions over time.

**Think of it as:** KDS's memory and learning system
- 📝 Remembers successful patterns
- ⚠️ Learns from mistakes
- 💡 Discovers relationships
- 🚀 Gets smarter with use

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
KDS BRAIN
├── knowledge-graph.yaml    → Aggregated learnings (structured knowledge)
├── events.jsonl            → Event stream (raw interaction logs)
├── brain-query.md          → Query agent (reads knowledge graph)
└── brain-updater.md        → Update agent (processes events)
```

### Knowledge Graph (knowledge-graph.yaml)

**Purpose:** Structured, aggregated knowledge

**Contains:**
- Intent patterns (successful/failed phrase mappings)
- File relationships (co-modification rates)
- Correction history (common mistakes)
- Workflow patterns (successful task sequences)
- Validation insights (common failures and fixes)
- Feature components (file mappings per feature)

**Example:**
```yaml
intent_patterns:
  plan:
    successful_phrases:
      - pattern: "add a * button"
        confidence: 0.95
        frequency: 12

file_relationships:
  HostControlPanelContent.razor:
    common_changes_with:
      wwwroot/css/noor-canvas.css: 0.75  # Modified together 75% of time
```

### Event Stream (events.jsonl)

**Purpose:** Raw event logs (append-only)

**Format:** JSON Lines (one event per line)

**Contains:**
- Intent detections
- File modifications
- Corrections
- Validations
- Test results
- Session lifecycle events

**Example:**
```json
{"timestamp":"2025-11-02T10:30:00Z","event":"intent_detected","intent":"plan","phrase":"add share button","confidence":0.95,"success":true}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-02T10:31:00Z","event":"file_modified","file":"HostControlPanelContent.razor","session":"fab-button"}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-02T10:32:00Z","event":"correction","type":"file_mismatch","incorrect":"HostControlPanel.razor","correct":"HostControlPanelContent.razor"}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **Capture Events** (Automatic)

Every KDS agent logs events:
```
User request → Router detects intent → Log event
Task executed → Executor modifies file → Log event
User corrects → Error corrector halts → Log event
Validation runs → Validator checks → Log event
```

### 2. **Process Events** (Periodic)

Brain Updater aggregates events:
```
events.jsonl → Parse events → Identify patterns → Update knowledge-graph.yaml
```

**Triggers:**
- After 50+ new events
- End of session
- Manual: `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md`

### 3. **Query for Insights** (Real-time)

Agents query BRAIN before making decisions:
```
Router: "What intent for 'add share button'?"
  → BRAIN: "PLAN intent, confidence 0.95 (12 similar successful patterns)"

Executor: "Related files for HostControlPanelContent.razor?"
  → BRAIN: "noor-canvas.css (co-modified 75% of time)"

Corrector: "Is HostControlPanel.razor commonly confused?"
  → BRAIN: "Yes! Often meant HostControlPanelContent.razor (12 corrections)"
```

### 4. **Improve Over Time** (Learning Loop)

```
Request 1: "add share button"
  → Router uses pattern matching (no BRAIN data yet)
  → Logs successful routing to PLAN intent
  
Request 2: "add export button"
  → Router queries BRAIN
  → BRAIN: "Similar to 'add share button' → PLAN (confidence 0.85)"
  → Logs successful routing
  
Request 3: "add download button"
  → Router queries BRAIN
  → BRAIN: "Matches pattern 'add * button' → PLAN (confidence 0.95, frequency 3)"
  → Auto-routes (no pattern matching needed!)
```

## 📊 What BRAIN Learns

### 1. Intent Patterns
**What:** Which phrases map to which intents  
**Why:** Faster, more accurate routing  
**Example:**
```yaml
plan:
  successful_phrases:
    - pattern: "I want to add *"
      confidence: 0.92
      frequency: 18
    - pattern: "create a * feature"
      confidence: 0.88
      frequency: 12
```

### 2. File Relationships
**What:** Which files are commonly modified together  
**Why:** Suggest related files proactively  
**Example:**
```yaml
HostControlPanelContent.razor:
  common_changes_with:
    wwwroot/css/noor-canvas.css: 0.75
    HostControlPanel.razor: 0.60
```

### 3. Correction History
**What:** Common mistakes and confusions  
**Why:** Warn before repeating mistakes  
**Example:**
```yaml
file_mismatch:
  common_mistakes:
    - incorrect: "HostControlPanel.razor"
      correct: "HostControlPanelContent.razor"
      frequency: 12
      context: "FAB button modifications"
```

### 4. Workflow Patterns
**What:** Successful task sequences  
**Why:** Recommend optimal workflows  
**Example:**
```yaml
UI_feature_workflow:
  sequence: [plan, execute, test, validate]
  success_rate: 0.92
  frequency: 45
```

### 5. Validation Insights
**What:** Common validation failures and fixes  
**Why:** Pre-apply known fixes  
**Example:**
```yaml
linting:
  failure_rate: 0.15
  common_fix: "fix-copilotchats-violations.ps1"
  fix_success_rate: 0.95
```

### 6. Feature Components
**What:** File mappings per feature  
**Why:** Understand feature scope  
**Example:**
```yaml
fab_button:
  primary_files: [HostControlPanelContent.razor]
  style_files: [wwwroot/css/noor-canvas.css]
  test_files: [Tests/UI/fab-button.spec.ts]
  sessions: [fab-button-animation, fab-button-pulse-fix]
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic (Standard Practice)

BRAIN operates automatically:
1. Agents log events (no user action needed)
2. Brain Updater processes periodically (no user action needed)
3. Agents query BRAIN (transparent to user)

**You don't need to do anything!** BRAIN works in the background.

### Manual Operations

#### Query BRAIN
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-query.md
query_type: intent_confidence
phrase: "add share button"
```

#### Update BRAIN
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md

Process all new events and update knowledge graph
```

#### Populate BRAIN (First Time)
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md

Scan all existing session files in KDS/sessions/ and populate BRAIN with historical patterns
```

## 📈 BRAIN Health

### Check BRAIN Status
View knowledge graph statistics:
```yaml
statistics:
  total_events_processed: 247
  last_updated: "2025-11-02T16:30:00Z"
  knowledge_graph_version: "1.0"
  confidence_threshold: 0.70
  learning_enabled: true
```

### BRAIN Quality Indicators

**Healthy BRAIN:**
- ✅ Events processed regularly (last_updated recent)
- ✅ High confidence patterns (> 0.70 for common intents)
- ✅ Rich file relationships (co-modification rates)
- ✅ Growing knowledge (increasing frequencies)

**Unhealthy BRAIN:**
- ❌ No recent updates (stale data)
- ❌ Low confidence patterns (< 0.50)
- ❌ Empty sections (no learning happened)
- ❌ Static frequencies (not accumulating knowledge)

---

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Pattern Generalization
BRAIN detects wildcards:
```yaml
# Input: "add share button", "add export button", "add print button"
# Output:
- pattern: "add * button"
  confidence: 0.93
  frequency: 3
  wildcard_position: 1
```

### Confidence Decay
Old patterns lose confidence:
```
Age > 30 days → confidence *= 0.95 (5% decay per update)
```

### Anomaly Detection
BRAIN flags unusual patterns:
```yaml
anomalies:
  - type: "unexpected_file_modification"
    description: "package.json modified during UI feature"
    session: "fab-button"
    investigate: true
```

---

## 🎓 Event Logging Standard

**All KDS agents MUST log events using this format:**

```jsonl
{"timestamp":"ISO8601","event":"event_type",...additional_fields}
```

**Common Event Types:**
- `intent_detected`
- `file_modified`
- `files_modified_together`
- `correction`
- `validation_failed`
- `validation_passed`
- `task_completed`
- `test_created`
- `test_passed`
- `test_failed`
- `session_started`
- `session_completed`

**Example from Code Executor:**
```json
{"timestamp":"2025-11-02T10:31:15Z","event":"file_modified","file":"HostControlPanelContent.razor","session":"fab-button","task":"Add pulse animation","lines_changed":23}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-02T10:32:00Z","event":"files_modified_together","files":["HostControlPanelContent.razor","wwwroot/css/noor-canvas.css"],"session":"fab-button"}
```
