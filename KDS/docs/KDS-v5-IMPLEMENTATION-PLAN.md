**Status:** 📋 PLANNING  
**Target:** Complete SOLID v5.0 + Memory System Foundation

---

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

### ✅ COMPLETED (Already Implemented)

1. **BRAIN System Infrastructure**
   - ✅ `KDS/kds-brain/` directory structure
   - ✅ `knowledge-graph.yaml` (schema defined)
   - ✅ `events.jsonl` (event logging system)
   - ✅ BRAIN README documentation
   - ✅ `brain-query.md` internal agent
   - ✅ `brain-updater.md` internal agent

2. **Specialist Agents (v5.0)**
   - ✅ `intent-router.md` (8 intents: PLAN, EXECUTE, TEST, VALIDATE, GOVERN, CORRECT, RESUME, ASK)
   - ✅ `work-planner.md` (planning only, no resume mode)
   - ✅ `code-executor.md` (execution only, no correction mode)
   - ✅ `error-corrector.md` (dedicated correction agent - ISP compliant)
   - ✅ `session-resumer.md` (dedicated resumption agent - ISP compliant)
   - ✅ `test-generator.md`
   - ✅ `health-validator.md`
   - ✅ `change-governor.md`
   - ✅ `knowledge-retriever.md`

3. **Shared Abstractions (DIP Compliance)**
   - ✅ `session-loader.md` (abstract session access)
   - ✅ `test-runner.md` (abstract test execution)
   - ✅ `file-accessor.md` (abstract file I/O)
   - ✅ `config-loader.md`

### ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION (May Be Partially Implemented)

1. **BRAIN Integration in Agents**
   - ⚠️ Does `intent-router.md` actually query BRAIN before pattern matching?
   - ⚠️ Do agents log events to `events.jsonl`?
   - ⚠️ Does `brain-updater.md` have working aggregation logic?
   - ⚠️ Does `brain-query.md` parse `knowledge-graph.yaml` correctly?

2. **Abstraction Integration**
   - ⚠️ Do agents use `session-loader.md` instead of direct file access?
   - ⚠️ Do agents use `test-runner.md` instead of hardcoded commands?
   - ⚠️ Do agents use `file-accessor.md` instead of direct I/O?

3. **SOLID Compliance**
   - ⚠️ Is `code-executor.md` truly execution-only (no correction logic)?
   - ⚠️ Is `work-planner.md` truly planning-only (no resumption logic)?
   - ⚠️ Is `error-corrector.md` fully functional as standalone agent?
   - ⚠️ Is `session-resumer.md` fully functional as standalone agent?

### ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (New Features)

1. **"Refresh Brain" Command**
   - ❌ User-facing command to trigger BRAIN knowledge refresh
   - ❌ Should consume recent session activity
   - ❌ Should modify/delete incorrect/redundant data intelligently
   - ❌ Should be callable via: `#file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md Refresh brain`

2. **"Setup Environment" Command**
   - ❌ User-facing command to install all dependencies
   - ❌ Should detect project type (.NET, Node.js, Python, etc.)
   - ❌ Should install required libraries/utilities/packages
   - ❌ Should use latest versions
   - ❌ Should be callable via: `#file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md Setup environment`
   - ⚠️ NOTE: `scripts/setup-kds-tooling.ps1` exists but may not be integrated into KDS command system

3. **Memory System (Future)**
   - ❌ 3-faculty system (retention, recollection, memorization)
   - ❌ `KDS/kds-memory/thoughts.yaml` storage
   - ❌ `Remember: [thought]` command
   - ❌ `What ideas did I stash about [topic]?` command
   - ❌ `Show all my stashed ideas` command
   - ❌ Integration with BRAIN for context-aware suggestions
   - ⚠️ Currently documented as "Idea 1" in KDS-DESIGN.md Future Considerations

## 📋 Implementation TODO List

### Phase 1: Verification & Documentation (CURRENT PRIORITY)

**Before implementing new features, verify what exists:**

1. **BRAIN System Verification**
   - [ ] Read `brain-query.md` - Check if query logic is implemented
   - [ ] Read `brain-updater.md` - Check if aggregation logic is implemented
   - [ ] Read `intent-router.md` - Check if BRAIN query is integrated
   - [ ] Check `events.jsonl` - See if agents are actually logging events
   - [ ] Check `knowledge-graph.yaml` - See if it has real data or just schema

2. **Abstraction Verification**
   - [ ] Read `session-loader.md` - Check if abstraction logic exists
   - [ ] Read `test-runner.md` - Check if abstraction logic exists
   - [ ] Read `file-accessor.md` - Check if abstraction logic exists
   - [ ] Grep agents for direct file access patterns (violations)

1. **BRAIN Integration (If Incomplete)**
   - [ ] Implement BRAIN query in `intent-router.md`
   - [ ] Add event logging to all agents
   - [ ] Implement aggregation logic in `brain-updater.md`
   - [ ] Test BRAIN learning loop end-to-end

2. **Abstraction Migration (If Incomplete)**
   - [ ] Replace direct file access with `file-accessor.md` calls

## 🎯 Execution Strategy

### Step 1: Document First (Rule #7)
Before any code changes:
1. ✅ Create this implementation plan
2. Update KDS-DESIGN.md with current state
3. Flag aspirational vs implemented features

### Step 2: Verify Current State
Read all agents and check:
1. What's actually implemented vs documented
2. What's partially done
3. What's completely missing

### Step 3: Prioritize Fixes
1. Fix SOLID violations (if any)
2. Complete BRAIN integration (if incomplete)
3. Migrate to abstractions (if hardcoded)

### Step 4: Implement New Features
1. Refresh Brain command
2. Setup Environment command
3. (Later) Memory System if approved

### Step 5: Test End-to-End
1. Test all 8 intents through universal entry point
2. Test BRAIN learning loop
3. Test new commands
4. Update documentation with actual behavior

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Aspirational Documentation
**Problem:** KDS docs describe features not yet implemented  
**Mitigation:** Phase 1 verification explicitly flags this  
**Action:** Update docs to match reality, create roadmap for aspirational features

### Risk 2: SOLID Violations Hidden
**Problem:** Agents may still have mode-switch logic  
**Mitigation:** Phase 1 grep for patterns like "if mode == 'correction'"  
**Action:** Refactor to dedicated agents

### Risk 3: Hardcoded Dependencies
**Problem:** Abstractions may not be fully adopted  
**Mitigation:** Phase 1 grep for direct file/command access  
**Action:** Migrate to abstraction layer

### Risk 4: Scope Creep (Memory System)
**Problem:** User wants many features simultaneously  
**Mitigation:** Phase 4 is explicitly "Future - Not Immediate"  
**Action:** Complete Phases 1-3 first, get approval before Phase 4
