# KDS Universal Entry Point

**Purpose:** Single command for ALL KDS interactions. You don't need to remember multiple commands - just use this one and KDS figures out what you need.

**Version:** 5.0 (SOLID Refactor)  
**Status:** 🎯 ACTIVE DESIGN  
**Architecture:** SOLID-compliant modular system

---

## 🎯 The ONLY Command You Need to Remember

```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md

[Tell KDS what you want in natural language]
```

That's it! KDS will automatically:
- ✅ Analyze your request (intent detection)
- ✅ Route to the appropriate specialist agent
- ✅ Execute the correct workflow
- ✅ Handle multi-step operations
- ✅ Maintain session state

---

## 🏗️ SOLID v5.0 Architecture

### What's New
- ✅ **Single Responsibility (SRP):** Each agent has ONE clear job
- ✅ **Interface Segregation (ISP):** Dedicated agents (no mode switches)
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion (DIP):** Abstractions for session/file/test access
- ✅ **Open/Closed (OCP):** Easy to extend (add new intents/agents)

### Specialist Agents (9 Total)
```
Router            → intent-router.md       → Analyzes & routes requests
Planner           → work-planner.md        → Creates multi-phase plans
Executor          → code-executor.md       → Implements code (test-first)
Tester            → test-generator.md      → Creates & runs tests
Validator         → health-validator.md    → System health checks
Governor          → change-governor.md     → Reviews KDS changes
Error Corrector   → error-corrector.md     → Fixes Copilot mistakes
Session Resumer   → session-resumer.md     → Resumes after breaks
Screenshot Analyzer → screenshot-analyzer.md → Extracts requirements from images (NEW)
```

### 🧠 BRAIN System (Self-Learning Feedback Loop)

**NEW in v5.0:** KDS learns from every interaction!  
**ENHANCED in v6.0:** Three-tier architecture with holistic development intelligence!

```
🧠 BRAIN = Three-Tier Intelligence System

Purpose: Learn from interactions, conversations, AND development activity
Storage: KDS/kds-brain/
- conversation-history.jsonl → Last 20 complete conversations (Tier 1)
- knowledge-graph.yaml       → Aggregated learnings (Tier 2)
- development-context.yaml   → Holistic project metrics (Tier 3) 🆕
- events.jsonl               → Raw event stream

Architecture: Three-tier system inspired by human cognition
- Tier 1 (Short-term): Last 20 conversations (FIFO queue, no time expiration)
- Tier 2 (Long-term): Consolidated patterns from deleted conversations
- Tier 3 (Context): Development activity, velocity, correlations 🆕
- Design: KDS/docs/architecture/BRAIN-CONVERSATION-MEMORY-DESIGN.md
- Tier 3 Design: KDS/docs/architecture/KDS-HOLISTIC-REVIEW-AND-RECOMMENDATIONS.md
- Validation: KDS/docs/architecture/CONVERSATION-MEMORY-SELF-REVIEW.md (health tracking)
```

**What BRAIN Learns:**
- ✅ Intent patterns (which phrases trigger which intents)
- ✅ File relationships (which files are modified together)
- ✅ Common mistakes (which corrections happen frequently)
- ✅ Workflow patterns (successful task sequences)
- ✅ Validation insights (common failures and fixes)
- ✅ **Conversation history (last 20 complete conversations, FIFO queue)** 🆕
- ✅ **Development velocity (code changes, commit patterns)** 🆕
- ✅ **Testing activity (pass rates, flaky tests, coverage)** 🆕
- ✅ **Work patterns (productive times, focus duration, correlations)** 🆕

**How Automatic Learning Works:**
```
Agent performs action
    ↓
Event logged to events.jsonl (automatic)
Message appended to active conversation
    ↓
Conversation boundary detected? → End conversation, start new one
    ↓
IF 21st conversation starts → Delete oldest conversation (FIFO)
    ↓
Event count checked after each task (Rule #16 Step 5)
    ↓
IF 50+ events OR 24 hours passed → Automatic BRAIN update
    ↓
brain-updater.md processes events → Updates knowledge-graph.yaml
Deleted conversations → Patterns extracted → Long-term memory
    ↓
Next request → Router queries BRAIN + conversation history → Smarter decisions with context
```

**Conversation History Benefits:**
- 🔄 **Continuity:** "Make it purple" knows you mean the FAB button from earlier conversation
- 🧩 **Cross-conversation context:** Reference any of the last 20 conversations
- 💬 **Natural follow-ups:** No need to repeat full context in every message
- 📝 **Reference resolution:** "Change that file" knows which file from conversation history
- ⏳ **Long-running work:** Conversation preserved until 20 newer conversations (days/weeks/months depending on usage)

**FIFO Queue (Conversation-Level):**
- 📊 **Capacity:** Last 20 complete conversations (not individual messages)
- 🔄 **Deletion:** When conversation #21 starts, conversation #1 deleted
- ⏰ **No time limits:** Conversations preserved until FIFO deletion (could be months for light usage)
- ✨ **Active conversation:** Never deleted (even if oldest)
- 🎯 **Pattern extraction:** Before deletion, patterns consolidated to long-term memory

**Privacy & Storage:**
- 🏠 **Local storage:** History stays in `KDS/kds-brain/conversation-history.jsonl`
- 💾 **Predictable size:** Always 20 conversations (~70-200 KB total)
- 🧹 **Manual clear:** Use `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/clear-conversation.md` to reset
- 🔒 **Deleted conversations:** Patterns extracted, details discarded

**Tier 3: Development Context (NEW in v6.0)**

**Purpose:** Holistic project understanding for data-driven planning and proactive warnings

**What's Tracked:**
```yaml
Git Activity:
  - Commit history (30 days)
  - Change velocity per week
  - File hotspots (high churn rate)
  - Contributors and patterns
  
Code Changes:
  - Lines added/deleted
  - Velocity trends (increasing/decreasing)
  - Churn rates per file
  - Stability classification
  
KDS Usage:
  - Session creation and completion rates
  - Intent distribution (PLAN, EXECUTE, TEST, etc.)
  - Workflow success rates
  - Test-first vs test-skip effectiveness
  
Testing Activity:
  - Test creation rate
  - Pass/fail rates
  - Flaky test detection
  - Coverage trends
  
Project Health:
  - Build status
  - Deployment frequency
  - Code quality metrics
  - Issue resolution times
  
Work Patterns:
  - Most productive times
  - Session duration averages
  - Feature lifecycle timing
  - Focus duration without interruptions
  
Correlations:
  - Commit size vs success rate
  - Test-first vs rework rate
  - KDS usage vs velocity
```

**Automatic Benefits:**
```
Planning Phase:
  → "Based on 12 similar UI features, estimated 5-6 days"
  → "Recommend 10am-12pm sessions (94% success rate at that time)"
  → "Test-first approach reduces rework by 68%"

File Modification:
  → "⚠️ HostControlPanel.razor is a hotspot (28% churn)"
  → "This file often modified with noor-canvas.css (75% co-mod rate)"
  → "Add extra testing - file is unstable"

Proactive Warnings:
  → "⚠️ Velocity dropped 68% this week (consider smaller commits)"
  → "⚠️ Flaky test detected: fab-button.spec.ts (15% failure rate)"
  → "✅ Test coverage increased from 72% to 76% (good trend!)"
```

**How to Collect:**
```powershell
# Manual collection
.\KDS\scripts\collect-development-context.ps1

# Automatic collection (runs after each BRAIN update)
# Triggered by brain-updater.md every 50 events or 24 hours
```

**Storage:**
- File: `KDS/kds-brain/development-context.yaml`
- Size: ~50-100 KB (holistic metrics, not raw data)
- Update: Hourly or after BRAIN update
- Purpose: Data-driven estimates, proactive warnings, velocity tracking

**Privacy & Storage:**
- 🏠 **Local storage:** History stays in `KDS/kds-brain/conversation-history.jsonl`
- 💾 **Predictable size:** Always 20 conversations (~70-200 KB total)
- 🧹 **Manual clear:** Use `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/clear-conversation.md` to reset
- 🔒 **Deleted conversations:** Patterns extracted, details discarded

**Automatic Update Triggers:**
1. **Event threshold:** 50+ new events accumulated
2. **Time threshold:** 24 hours since last update (if 10+ events exist)
3. **End of session:** When all tasks in session complete
4. **Manual trigger:** User explicitly calls `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md`

**🚨 CRITICAL: Event Logging Must Be Active**

For automatic learning to work:
- ✅ All agents MUST log events to `events.jsonl`
- ✅ Events follow standard format (see `KDS/kds-brain/README.md`)
- ✅ `events.jsonl` must be writable (check file permissions)
- ✅ Rule #16 Step 5 must include BRAIN health check

**If BRAIN isn't learning:**
1. Check `events.jsonl` exists and has recent events
2. Verify `knowledge-graph.yaml` updated in last 24 hours
3. Count unprocessed events (warn if >50)
4. Run manual update: `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md`

**See:** `KDS/docs/architecture/KDS-SELF-REVIEW-STRATEGY.md` for violation detection

**How It Works:**
```
User request → Router queries BRAIN → High confidence? → Auto-route
                                   → Low confidence? → Pattern matching

Agent action → Log event → BRAIN updater processes → Knowledge graph updated

Next request → Router gets smarter (learned from history)
```

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 Faster routing (learns successful patterns)
- ⚠️ Prevents mistakes (warns about common file confusions)
- 💡 Suggests related files (based on co-modification history)
- 📊 Improves over time (accumulates knowledge)

**BRAIN Agents:**
```
brain-query.md   → Query knowledge graph AND development context for insights
brain-updater.md → Process events, update graph, trigger Tier 3 collection
conversation-context-manager.md → Track recent messages for continuity (NEW)
clear-conversation.md → Reset conversation context (NEW)
development-context-collector.md → Collect git, test, build metrics (Tier 3) 🆕
```

### Shared Abstractions (DIP Compliance)
```
session-loader → Abstract session access (file/db/cloud agnostic)
test-runner    → Abstract test execution (framework agnostic)
file-accessor  → Abstract file I/O (path agnostic)
brain-query    → Abstract BRAIN queries (self-learning system)

CRITICAL: All abstractions are 100% LOCAL (in KDS/).
- Default storage: Local files (KDS/sessions/)
- Default tests: Project's existing tools (discovered, not installed)
- Default I/O: PowerShell built-ins (Get-Content, Set-Content)
- Default BRAIN: Local YAML/JSON (KDS/kds-brain/)
- Zero external dependencies for KDS CORE
- Cloud/database options are OPTIONAL extensions (user's choice)
```

### 📦 Open Source Library Policy

**KDS Enhancement Libraries (ALLOWED)**

Open source libraries that enhance KDS functionality are PERMITTED when:
- ✅ They are declared as **required dependencies** during KDS setup
- ✅ They are included in setup instructions (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- ✅ User is informed upfront that these are needed to proceed
- ✅ They enhance KDS capabilities (routing, analysis, testing, validation)

**Examples of Acceptable KDS Dependencies:**
```json
// package.json (if KDS uses Node.js enhancements)
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "markdown-it": "^13.0.0",      // Enhanced markdown parsing for intent analysis
    "yaml": "^2.3.0",                // YAML parsing for configuration
    "chalk": "^5.3.0"                // Terminal output formatting
  }
}

// requirements.txt (if KDS uses Python enhancements)
markdown-it-py>=3.0.0    # Enhanced markdown processing
pyyaml>=6.0              # YAML configuration parsing
rich>=13.0.0             # Beautiful terminal output
```

**NOT Considered External Dependencies:**
- Libraries needed for KDS core functionality (router, planner, executor)
- Libraries that improve intent detection accuracy
- Libraries that enhance session state management
- Libraries that provide better error reporting/logging

**STILL External Dependencies (Require User Approval):**
- Libraries for the user's APPLICATION code (React, SignalR, etc.)
- Libraries that change application architecture
- Libraries that affect production deployment
- Database/cloud providers not already in use

**Setup Protocol:**
When recommending KDS enhancement libraries:
```markdown
⚠️ **KDS Enhancement Dependencies Required**

To proceed with this KDS feature, the following libraries are needed:

📦 Node.js (npm install):
  - markdown-it: Enhanced markdown parsing for intent analysis
  - yaml: Configuration file parsing
  
Installation:
  npm install --save-dev markdown-it yaml

These are KDS-internal dependencies and won't affect your application code.

Proceed with installation? (Y/n)
```

## 🧪 Playwright Testing Protocol (PowerShell)

**CRITICAL RULE: All Playwright test automation scripts MUST follow the established protocol pattern.**

**⚠️ LONG-RUNNING PROCESS:** Test automation scripts often run >30 seconds. Follow the Long-Running Process Protocol (see Setup section) for:
- Padded time estimates (add 25-50% buffer to test execution time)
- Status updates during app startup and test execution
- Progress indicators when running multiple test files
- Graceful Ctrl+C handling with cleanup

### 🎯 CRITICAL: Component ID-Based Selectors (TDD Requirement)

**RULE:** Always use element IDs for Playwright selectors. Text-based selectors are FRAGILE and PROHIBITED.

**WHY:**
- ✅ 10x faster (getElementById vs DOM text search)
- ✅ Immune to text changes (i18n, wording updates, HTML restructuring)
- ✅ Explicit intent (`#login-btn` is clearer than `button:has-text("Login")`)
- ✅ No false positives (unique ID vs multiple matching texts)

**WRONG (FRAGILE - DO NOT USE):**
```typescript
// ❌ BREAKS when text changes, slow DOM search, ambiguous
const button = page.locator('button:has-text("Start Session")').first();
const link = page.locator('div:has-text("Transcript Canvas")');
```

**CORRECT (ROBUST - ALWAYS USE):**
```typescript
// ✅ Fast, reliable, explicit, future-proof
const button = page.locator('#sidebar-start-session-btn');
const link = page.locator('#reg-transcript-canvas-btn');
```

**Component ID Discovery:**
Before writing ANY Playwright test, discover available IDs:
1. Open target component file (e.g., `HostControlPanelSidebar.razor`)
2. Search for `id="` attributes
3. Use those IDs in your test selectors
4. If no ID exists → ADD ONE to the component (with `[REFACTOR:component-id]` comment)

**Enforcement:**
- Test reviews MUST reject text-based selectors
- KDS test-generator SHOULD warn when ID exists but text selector used
- Future: Automated crawler will build `KDS/cache/component-ids.json`

### Application Routes & Tokens

**Host Control Panel:**
- Route: `https://localhost:9091/host/control-panel/{hostToken}`
- Page File: `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/HostControlPanel.razor`
- Component File: `SPA/NoorCanvas/Components/Host/HostControlPanelContent.razor`
- Session 212 Token: `PQ9N5YWW`
- Full URL: `https://localhost:9091/host/control-panel/PQ9N5YWW`

**Component IDs (Host Control Panel):**
| Element | Component | ID | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|-----|---------|
| Transcript Canvas Button | UserRegistrationLink.razor | `reg-transcript-canvas-btn` | Select transcript canvas mode |
| Asset Canvas Button | UserRegistrationLink.razor | `reg-asset-canvas-btn` | Select asset canvas mode |
| Start Session Button | HostControlPanelSidebar.razor | `sidebar-start-session-btn` | Initiate session |
| Registration Link Container | UserRegistrationLink.razor | `reg-link-container` | Parent container for canvas buttons |

### Standard Protocol Pattern

**Reference Implementation:** `Scripts/run-debug-panel-percy-tests.ps1`

**Required Steps:**
1. ✅ Launch app using `Start-Job` with `dotnet run` (NOT Start-Process)
2. ✅ Wait for app readiness (20 seconds minimum, or health check loop)
3. ✅ Run Playwright tests using `npx playwright test [file] --headed`
4. ✅ Cleanup with `Stop-Job` and `Remove-Job` (unless -KeepAppRunning)

### Correct Pattern (FOLLOW THIS)

```powershell
param([switch]$KeepAppRunning)

# Step 1: Start app with Start-Job
$appJob = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
    Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA\NoorCanvas'
    dotnet run
}

# Step 2: Wait for readiness (20s minimum)
Start-Sleep -Seconds 20

# Step 3: Run Playwright tests
try {
    Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS'
    npx playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
    $exitCode = $LASTEXITCODE
}
finally {
    # Step 4: Cleanup
    if (-not $KeepAppRunning) {
        Stop-Job -Job $appJob -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        Remove-Job -Job $appJob -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    }
}

exit $exitCode
```

### WRONG Patterns (NEVER DO THIS)

❌ **Using Start-Process with -ArgumentList:**
```powershell
# WRONG - Don't use Start-Process with complex arguments
$proc = Start-Process -FilePath "npx" -ArgumentList $testArgs -NoNewWindow -Wait -PassThru
```

❌ **Using Invoke-WebRequest for health checks without proper error handling:**
```powershell
# WRONG - Complex health check that can fail unpredictably
$resp = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $appUrl -SkipCertificateCheck -TimeoutSec 5
```

❌ **Separating test running from working directory:**
```powershell
# WRONG - Don't Push-Location multiple times
Push-Location $testsPath
npx playwright test
Pop-Location
```

### Playwright Command Format

**Correct:**
```powershell
# Set working directory ONCE, then run test
Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS'
npx playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
```

**For Percy visual tests:**
```powershell
# Percy wraps Playwright
percy exec -- playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
```

**Capture exit code:**
```powershell
npx playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
$exitCode = $LASTEXITCODE
exit $exitCode
```

### Test Script Checklist

Before creating ANY Playwright test automation script, verify:

```
✓ Uses Start-Job (not Start-Process) for app launch?
✓ Waits minimum 20 seconds for app readiness?
✓ Sets working directory to project root (not Tests/UI)?
✓ Runs npx playwright test with direct command (no Start-Process)?
✓ Captures $LASTEXITCODE for exit status?
✓ Cleans up with Stop-Job and Remove-Job?
✓ Supports -KeepAppRunning parameter?

If ANY answer is NO → FIX before running
```

### Reference Scripts

**Study these working examples:**
- ✅ `Scripts/run-debug-panel-percy-tests.ps1` - Full featured (health checks, Percy, detailed logging)
- ✅ `Scripts/run-transcript-canvas-visual-tests.ps1` - Simple pattern (20s wait, basic cleanup)
- ✅ `Scripts/run-fab-share-button-percy-tests.ps1` - Percy visual regression pattern

**Key Patterns:**
```powershell
# App Launch
$appJob = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
    Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA\NoorCanvas'
    dotnet run
}

# Wait Pattern (Simple)
Start-Sleep -Seconds 20

# Wait Pattern (Health Check - Advanced)
while ($attempt -lt $maxAttempts) {
    try {
        $resp = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $appUrl -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 5
        if ($resp.StatusCode -eq 200) { break }
    } catch {
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
    }
    $attempt++
}

# Test Execution
Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS'
npx playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
$exitCode = $LASTEXITCODE

# Cleanup
Stop-Job -Job $appJob -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Job -Job $appJob -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## 🏗️ Architectural Thinking Mandate

**CRITICAL RULE: All KDS agents MUST think architecturally when proposing solutions.**

### Core Principles

**1. Architecture-First Design**
- ✅ Understand existing application architecture BEFORE proposing solutions
- ✅ Design solutions that naturally fit the current architecture from the start
- ❌ NEVER propose monolithic implementations that need refactoring later
- ❌ NEVER create "everything in one file" with intent to break apart later

**2. Pre-Flight Architectural Validation**
Every solution proposal must pass this refactor logic check:

```
BEFORE proposing a solution:
  ↓
1. Identify current architectural patterns
   - Component structure (where do similar components live?)
   - API organization (where do similar APIs exist?)
   - Service layer patterns (how are services currently structured?)
   - State management (what patterns are in use?)
   - File organization (what's the project structure?)
   ↓
2. Run mental refactor test
   - Would this solution require significant refactoring to fit the architecture?
   - Am I creating files that don't match existing conventions?
   - Am I mixing concerns that are separated elsewhere?
   ↓
3. If refactor is needed → REDESIGN the solution
   - Align with existing patterns
   - Follow established separation of concerns
   - Place files in correct locations from the start
   ↓
4. Only then propose the architecturally-aligned solution
```

**3. Forbidden Anti-Patterns**

❌ **NEVER do this:**
```
❌ "Let's create everything in PageComponent.razor first, then we'll break out 
   the child components later"
   
❌ "I'll add the API logic to the page for now, we can move it to a service later"

❌ "Let's put this in a temporary location and reorganize after it works"

❌ "We'll create the monolith first, then refactor to match your architecture"
```

✅ **ALWAYS do this:**
```
✅ "Based on the existing component structure in Components/Canvas/, 
   I'll create CanvasPdfExport.razor there and import it into the parent"
   
✅ "Following the pattern in Services/, I'll create PdfExportService.cs 
   and inject it via DI as seen in other services"

✅ "The existing API controllers are in Controllers/API/, so I'll create 
   PdfExportController.cs there with the same routing pattern"

✅ "This matches the architecture - components are separated, services handle 
   business logic, and APIs are in the correct location from the start"
```

**4. Architectural Discovery Process**

Before proposing ANY solution, agents must:

```
Step 1: Discover Current Architecture
  - Search for similar features/components
  - Identify existing patterns and conventions
  - Map out file organization structure
  - Understand separation of concerns

Step 2: Pattern Matching
  - "Where do similar components live?"
  - "How are APIs currently organized?"
  - "What's the service layer pattern?"
  - "How is state managed?"

Step 3: Alignment Check
  - Does my solution follow these patterns?
  - Are files in the right locations?
  - Is separation of concerns maintained?
  - Would a developer familiar with this codebase find this natural?

Step 4: Propose Solution
  - Only after architectural alignment is confirmed
  - Explicitly state which patterns you're following
  - Show how it fits the existing structure
```

**5. Implementation Example**

**BAD (Anti-Pattern):**
```markdown
Plan: Add PDF export feature

Phase 1: Create basic implementation
  - Task 1.1: Add export logic to TranscriptCanvas.razor
  - Task 1.2: Test the functionality
  
Phase 2: Refactor to proper architecture
  - Task 2.1: Extract to PdfExportService
  - Task 2.2: Create dedicated component
  - Task 2.3: Move to API controller

❌ This violates architectural thinking - refactoring is built into the plan!
```

**GOOD (Architecturally Aligned):**
```markdown
Plan: Add PDF export feature

Phase 0: Architectural Discovery
  - Task 0.1: Map existing service patterns (Services/)
  - Task 0.2: Identify component organization (Components/)
  - Task 0.3: Review API structure (Controllers/API/)

Phase 1: Test Infrastructure (following existing test patterns)
  - Task 1.1: Create PdfExportServiceTests.cs (Tests/Unit/Services/)
  - Task 1.2: Create PdfExportController tests (Tests/Unit/Controllers/)
  - Task 1.3: Create visual tests (Tests/UI/pdf-export.spec.ts)

Phase 2: Implementation (architecturally aligned from start)
  - Task 2.1: Create PdfExportService.cs in Services/
  - Task 2.2: Create PdfExportButton.razor in Components/Canvas/
  - Task 2.3: Create PdfExportController.cs in Controllers/API/
  - Task 2.4: Register service in DI (Program.cs pattern)

✅ This is architecturally correct from the start - no refactoring needed!
```

**6. Agent-Specific Requirements**

**Work Planner (work-planner.md):**
- ✅ MUST include "Phase 0: Architectural Discovery" for new features
- ✅ Plans must show architectural alignment in task descriptions
- ✅ File paths must match existing conventions

**Code Executor (code-executor.md):**
- ✅ MUST verify file location matches architecture before creating
- ✅ MUST follow existing patterns for similar features
- ✅ MUST NOT create temporary/placeholder implementations

**Test Generator (test-generator.md):**
- ✅ Tests must mirror the application's architectural organization
- ✅ Test files must be placed following existing test structure

**7. Validation Checkpoint**

Before ANY code generation, agents must answer:

```
✓ Have I identified where similar code lives in this architecture?
✓ Am I following the existing file organization patterns?
✓ Is my separation of concerns consistent with the codebase?
✓ Would this solution require refactoring to fit the architecture?
✓ Am I creating files in their permanent, correct locations?

If ANY answer is NO → STOP and redesign the solution
```

**8. Success Criteria**

A solution is architecturally valid when:
- ✅ No refactoring phase exists in the plan
- ✅ Files are in correct locations from creation
- ✅ Patterns match existing similar features
- ✅ Separation of concerns is maintained from start
- ✅ A developer familiar with the codebase would say "this fits naturally"

#file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md Setup
```

This triggers the complete KDS initialization sequence.

**⏱️ Expected Duration: 15-20 minutes** (padded estimate)
- Small project (<1000 files): ~10-12 minutes
- Medium project (1000-5000 files): ~15-18 minutes  
- Large project (>5000 files): ~20-25 minutes

**🔔 Status Updates:** You'll receive progress updates every 30-60 seconds so you know the system is working.

---

### 📋 Setup Sequence (Automatic)

When you invoke `Setup`, KDS executes this sequence:

**⚙️ RULE: Long-Running Process Protocol**

ALL long-running operations (>30 seconds) in KDS MUST:
1. ✅ Display padded time estimate upfront (add 25-50% buffer)
2. ✅ Show phase-by-phase progress indicators
3. ✅ Provide status updates every 30-60 seconds
4. ✅ Display percentage complete when measurable
5. ✅ Show "Still working..." heartbeat for CPU-intensive tasks
6. ✅ Explain what's happening (not just "Processing...")
7. ✅ Allow graceful interruption (Ctrl+C with cleanup)

**Examples of long-running operations:**
- Setup sequence (15-20 min)
- Deep crawler (5-10 min)
- Development context collection (2-5 min)
- BRAIN updates with large event backlogs (1-3 min)
- Test suite runs (varies)
- Build processes (varies)

**See:** Full protocol at end of this section

### 📊 Long-Running Process Protocol (UNIVERSAL RULE)

**APPLIES TO:** All KDS operations >30 seconds

**Required Elements:**

1. **Upfront Expectation Setting**
   ```
   ⏱️  Estimated time: X-Y minutes (padded 25-50%)
   ⚠️  This is the longest phase - please be patient!
   ```

2. **Visual Progress Indicators**
   ```
   📊 Progress: [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░] 45%
   🔄 Phase 3/6: Knowledge Graph Population
   ```

3. **Heartbeat Status Updates**
   ```
   Every 30-60 seconds:
   [00:30] Still working on X... (detail what's happening)
   [01:00] Processing Y... (show counts/progress)
   [01:30] Almost done with Z... (reassure user)
   ```

4. **Informative Messages**
   ```
   ❌ BAD: "Processing..." (vague, scary)
   ✅ GOOD: "Analyzing 1,247 commits for velocity patterns..."
   
   ❌ BAD: "Please wait..." (no context)
   ✅ GOOD: "Scanning 612 files for architectural patterns (2m 30s elapsed)"
   ```

5. **Completion Confirmation**
   ```
   Status: ✅ Phase complete in 4m 23s
   📊 Progress: [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓] 65% → 75%
   ```

6. **Graceful Interruption**
   ```
   ⏸️  You can press Ctrl+C to cancel
   ⚠️  Cleanup will run automatically if interrupted
   ```

7. **Error Recovery Guidance**
   ```
   If something goes wrong:
   ❌ Error at Phase 3 (2m 15s elapsed)
   💡 You can:
      1. Retry this phase only
      2. Skip and continue (if non-critical)
      3. Cancel and review logs
   ```

**Implementation Checklist:**

For ALL long-running operations, verify:
- ☐ Padded time estimate shown upfront (realistic + buffer)
- ☐ Phase/step breakdown displayed
- ☐ Progress bar or percentage shown
- ☐ Status updates every 30-60 seconds minimum
- ☐ Detailed "what's happening now" messages
- ☐ Elapsed time counter visible
- ☐ Graceful Ctrl+C handling
- ☐ Clear completion confirmation
- ☐ Error messages with recovery options

**Examples in KDS:**

```markdown
Long-Running Operations:
✓ Setup (15-20 min) - Has all required elements above
✓ Deep Crawler (5-10 min) - Needs status updates added
✓ Development Context Collection (2-5 min) - Needs progress bar
✓ BRAIN Update with backlog (1-3 min) - Needs heartbeat
✓ Test Suite Execution (varies) - Needs all elements
✓ Build Processes (varies) - Needs all elements
```

**Agents Responsible:**

All specialist agents that trigger long operations:
- `work-planner.md` - When creating large plans
- `code-executor.md` - When running builds/tests
- `test-generator.md` - When generating many tests
- `health-validator.md` - When running full validation
- `brain-crawler.md` - When scanning codebase
- `development-context-collector.md` - When analyzing history
- `brain-updater.md` - When processing large backlogs

**PowerShell Script Requirements:**

All KDS scripts (`.ps1`) MUST include:
```powershell
# At start
Write-Host "⏱️  Estimated time: 3-5 minutes" -ForegroundColor Yellow
$stopwatch = [System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()

# During execution (every 30-60s)
Write-Host "[$(($stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds).ToString('00.0'))s] Still working on X..." -ForegroundColor Cyan

# At completion
$stopwatch.Stop()
Write-Host "✅ Complete in $($stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalMinutes.ToString('0.0'))m" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**See Also:**
- Playwright Testing Protocol (uses 20s wait with status)
- Health Validator (should show check-by-check progress)
- Crawler modes (quick vs deep time estimates)

---

### 🎯 Setup Modes

**Default Mode: Full Setup (Recommended)**

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Setup

**Setup fails at Phase 1 (Validation):**
```
Cause: Missing KDS files or permissions issue
Fix: 
  1. Verify KDS/ directory copied completely
  2. Check file permissions (should be readable/writable)
  3. Ensure Git is installed and accessible
```

**Setup fails at Phase 2 (Crawler):**
```
Cause: Large codebase (>10,000 files) or binary files
Fix:
  1. Use Setup --quick (skips deep scan)
  2. Manually run targeted crawler later
  3. Add skip patterns to KDS/kds-brain/crawler-config.yaml
```

**Setup succeeds but queries fail:**
```
Cause: Knowledge graph structure invalid
Fix:
  1. Check KDS/kds-brain/knowledge-graph.yaml syntax
  2. Re-run: #file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
  3. Validate with: #file:KDS/prompts/internal/health-validator.md
```

---

### ✅ Setup Success Indicators

You'll know setup succeeded when:

```
✓ All 6 phases completed without errors
✓ KDS/setup-report-{timestamp}.md exists
✓ knowledge-graph.yaml has 50+ entries
✓ development-context.yaml has baseline metrics
✓ Health validator reports "All checks passed"
✓ Test query returns architectural patterns
✓ First kds.md request routes correctly
```

---

### 🎓 Post-Setup Best Practices

**1. Verify BRAIN Learning:**
```
After your first few KDS interactions:

Check: KDS/kds-brain/events.jsonl (should have new events)
Check: conversation-history.jsonl (should have conversations)
Run: #file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md (manual update)
Verify: knowledge-graph.yaml updated with your patterns
```

**2. Regular Maintenance:**
```
Daily: Let automatic learning work (no action needed)
Weekly: Check proactive_warnings in development-context.yaml
Monthly: Run incremental crawler (keep structure current)
After refactoring: Run deep crawler (re-learn architecture)
```

**3. Optimize for Your Workflow:**
```
If KDS misroutes frequently:
  → Check intent_patterns in knowledge-graph.yaml
  → Add manual entries for your common phrases
  
If file suggestions wrong:
  → Check architectural_patterns
  → Run targeted crawler on new modules
  
If estimates inaccurate:
  → Let development-context accumulate data (2-4 weeks)
  → Correlations improve with more history
```

## 🤖 How It Works

### Step 1: Intent Detection
When you use `kds.md`, it loads the **Intent Router** agent which analyzes your request.

**Router reads:**
```yaml
keywords:
  plan: ["I want to", "add a", "create a", "build a", "implement"]
  execute: ["continue", "next task", "keep going", "proceed"]
  resume: ["where was I", "show progress", "left off", "resume"]
  correct: ["wrong file", "not what I", "actually", "correction"]
  test: ["test", "visual regression", "playwright", "unit test"]
  validate: ["health", "validate", "check", "run all", "status"]
  ask: ["how do I", "what is", "explain", "tell me about"]
  govern: ["I updated KDS", "I modified KDS", "review my changes"]
```

### Step 2: Routing Decision
```
User: "I want to add dark mode"
  ↓
Intent Router: Detects "I want to add" = PLAN intent
  ↓
Routes to: plan.md → work-planner.md
  ↓
Creates multi-phase plan, saves session state
```

### Step 3: Execution
The appropriate specialist agent executes:
- **Planner:** Breaks work into phases/tasks
- **Executor:** Implements code changes
- **Tester:** Creates and runs tests
- **Validator:** Checks system health
- **Governor:** Reviews KDS modifications
- **Knowledge Retriever:** Answers questions

### Step 4: Handoff (If Multi-Step)
For complex requests like "Add dark mode and test it":
```
User: "I want to add dark mode and test it"
  ↓
Intent Router: Detects TWO intents (PLAN + TEST)
  ↓
Routes to: plan.md → work-planner.md
  ↓
Planner creates plan with testing phase
  ↓
Tells you: "Next: #file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md continue"
  ↓
You: "continue"
  ↓
Routes to: execute.md → code-executor.md
  ↓
Implements code → Routes to: test.md → test-generator.md
  ↓
Creates tests → Validates → Complete
```

## 🎯 Intent Detection Rules

**LOAD:** `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/intent-router.md`

The router uses these patterns:

### PRIMARY INTENT (Choose One)

**PLAN** - Starting new feature work
```
Patterns: "I want to", "add a", "create a", "build", "implement"
Examples: 
  - "I want to add a share button"
  - "Create a PDF export feature"
  - "Build a dark mode toggle"
```

**EXECUTE** - Continue active session
```
Patterns: "continue", "next", "keep going", "proceed", "execute"
Examples:
  - "Continue working"
  - "Next task"
  - "Keep going"
```

**RESUME** - Pickup after interruption
```
Patterns: "resume", "where was I", "show progress", "left off", "status"
Examples:
  - "Show me where I left off"
  - "What's the current status?"
  - "Resume work"
```

**CORRECT** - Fix Copilot error
```
Patterns: "wrong", "not that", "actually", "correction", "fix"
Examples:
  - "You're working on the wrong file"
  - "That's not what I meant"
  - "Actually, use SignalR not polling"
```

**TEST** - Create or run tests
```
Patterns: "test", "playwright", "visual regression", "unit test"
Examples:
  - "Create visual tests for the button"
  - "Run all Playwright tests"
  - "Add unit tests for the service"
```

**VALIDATE** - System health check
```
Patterns: "validate", "health", "check", "run all", "quality"
Examples:
  - "Check system health"
  - "Validate all changes"
  - "Run quality checks"
```

**ASK** - Question about KDS/codebase
```
Patterns: "how do I", "what is", "explain", "tell me", "?"
Examples:
  - "How do I test canvas elements?"
  - "What test patterns exist?"
  - "Explain the session state"
```

**GOVERN** - Review KDS changes
```
Patterns: "I updated KDS", "modified KDS", "review", "KDS change"
Examples:
  - "I updated the test-generator"
  - "Review my KDS modifications"
  - "I changed the rules"
```

## ✅ Benefits of Universal Entry Point + SOLID v5.0

### User Experience
- ✅ **One command to remember** (`kds.md`)
- ✅ **Natural language** - say what you want
- ✅ **No cognitive load** - don't need to know which specialist to call
- ✅ **Forgiving** - works even if you're vague
- ✅ **Predictable** - same command, consistent behavior

### Technical Benefits (SOLID v5.0)
- ✅ **Intelligent routing** - right agent for the job
- ✅ **Multi-intent handling** - complex requests work
- ✅ **Context preservation** - session state via abstraction
- ✅ **Automatic workflows** - no manual orchestration
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - each agent focused on one job
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion** - swap storage/tools without breaking agents
- ✅ **Interface Segregation** - no mode switches, dedicated specialists
- ✅ **Easy to test** - mock abstractions, isolate agents

### Architecture Benefits
- 🎯 **Modular** - add new agents without touching existing ones
- 🔧 **Maintainable** - fix bugs in one place
- 🚀 **Performant** - no mode-switch overhead
- 📦 **Portable** - abstractions make storage/tools swappable
- 🏠 **Local-First** - 100% in KDS/, zero external dependencies
- 🔒 **Offline-Capable** - works without internet (except optional cloud features)
- 🆓 **Zero-Install** - no npm/pip/dotnet packages required for KDS

### Comparison

**Before v5.0 (7 commands + mode switches):**
```
plan.md → for new features
execute.md → for continuing work + corrections (mode switch)
resume.md → after breaks (actually loads work-planner)
correct.md → for fixing errors (loads executor in correction mode)
test.md → for creating tests
validate.md → for health checks
ask-kds.md → for questions
govern.md → for KDS changes

Issues:
❌ Executor does 2 jobs (execution + correction)
❌ Planner does 2 jobs (planning + resumption)
❌ Hardcoded file paths everywhere
❌ Hardcoded test commands
```

**After v5.0 (1 command + SOLID compliance):**
```
kds.md → for EVERYTHING
  ↓
intent-router.md → routes to 8 focused specialists
  ↓
Specialists use shared abstractions (session-loader, test-runner, file-accessor)

Benefits:
✅ Each agent has ONE responsibility
✅ Error correction is dedicated (error-corrector.md)
✅ Session resumption is dedicated (session-resumer.md)
✅ Abstractions decouple from storage/tools
✅ Easy to extend (add new agent = add new route)
```

## 🚫 When Routing Fails

**If intent is ambiguous:**
```
You: #file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md
     do something

Router: ❓ Intent unclear. Did you mean:
        1. Continue current work? (execute)
        2. Check progress? (resume)
        3. Validate changes? (validate)
        
        Please clarify.
```

**If no active session and you say "continue":**
```
You: #file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md
     continue

Router: ❌ No active session found.
        Did you mean to start new work?
        Use: "I want to [describe feature]"
```

## 📊 SOLID v5.0 Design Benefits

### Answer: YES - It Makes KDS Better!

**Design Improvements:**
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each agent has ONE clear job
- ✅ **Interface Segregation** - No mode switches (dedicated agents)
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion** - Abstractions decouple from concrete implementations
- ✅ **Open/Closed** - Easy to extend (add agents) without modifying existing code

**SOLID v5.0 Architecture:**
```
User Interface Layer:
  kds.md (universal) ────────┐
  plan.md (direct)   ────────┤
  execute.md (direct) ───────┤
  test.md (direct)    ───────┤  All route through
  correct.md (direct) ───────┤
  resume.md (direct)  ───────┤
  ...                        ├─→ intent-router.md (ROUTER)
                             │
Internal Agent Layer:        │
  work-planner.md     ←──────┤  (PLAN only)
  code-executor.md    ←──────┤  (EXECUTE only)
  error-corrector.md  ←──────┤  (CORRECT only - NEW)
  session-resumer.md  ←──────┤  (RESUME only - NEW)
  test-generator.md   ←──────┤  (TEST only)
  health-validator.md ←──────┤  (VALIDATE only)
  change-governor.md  ←──────┤  (GOVERN only)
  knowledge-retriever.md ←───┘  (ASK only)
  
Abstraction Layer (DIP):
  session-loader.md   → Abstract session access
  test-runner.md      → Abstract test execution
  file-accessor.md    → Abstract file I/O
```

**What Changed from v4.5:**
```diff
- code-executor.md (execution + correction modes) ❌ SRP violation
+ code-executor.md (execution only) ✅ SRP compliant
+ error-corrector.md (correction only) ✅ ISP compliant

- work-planner.md (planning + resumption modes) ❌ SRP violation
+ work-planner.md (planning only) ✅ SRP compliant
+ session-resumer.md (resumption only) ✅ ISP compliant

- Direct file access (#file:KDS/sessions/...) ❌ DIP violation
+ Abstract access (session-loader.md) ✅ DIP compliant

- Hardcoded test commands (npx playwright test) ❌ DIP violation
+ Abstract runner (test-runner.md) ✅ DIP compliant
```

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 **Clarity** - One agent = one job (easier to understand)
- 🚀 **Performance** - No mode-switch logic (faster routing)
- 🔧 **Testability** - Mock abstractions (easier to test)
- 📦 **Flexibility** - Swap storage/tools without breaking agents

**Flexibility:**
```
Option 1 (Easy): Use kds.md universal entry point
Option 2 (Explicit): Call specific prompts directly
Option 3 (Advanced): Call internal agents with abstractions

All work! Universal is for convenience, SOLID is for quality.
```

## 🧠 BRAIN System Best Practices

### Automatic Learning is ENABLED by Default

**KDS v5.0+ automatically logs events and updates BRAIN - no user action needed!**

**What happens automatically:**
1. ✅ Agents log events after every action (routing, file modifications, corrections)
2. ✅ Events accumulate in `KDS/kds-brain/events.jsonl`
3. ✅ Rule #16 Step 5 checks event count after each task
4. ✅ When 50 events reached → `brain-updater.md` auto-triggered
5. ✅ Knowledge graph updated with new patterns
6. ✅ Next routing decision gets smarter

**You benefit without doing anything!**

### Verify BRAIN is Learning (Optional Health Check)

**Want to confirm automatic learning is working?**

Check these indicators:
```bash
# 1. Recent events logged (should have timestamps from today)
cat KDS/kds-brain/events.jsonl | tail -5

# 2. Knowledge graph updated recently (check last modified)
ls -la KDS/kds-brain/knowledge-graph.yaml

# 3. Event count reasonable (not accumulating to 100+)
wc -l KDS/kds-brain/events.jsonl
```

**Healthy BRAIN signs:**
- ✅ `events.jsonl` has recent timestamps (within last few hours)
- ✅ `knowledge-graph.yaml` updated in last 24 hours
- ✅ Event count stays below 50 (auto-cleanup working)

**⚠️ Warning signs (violations detected):**
- ❌ No events logged for 4+ hours (event logging broken)
- ❌ `knowledge-graph.yaml` not updated in 24+ hours
- ❌ 50+ unprocessed events accumulated (automatic update not triggering)

**If you see warnings:** See `KDS/docs/architecture/KDS-SELF-REVIEW-STRATEGY.md` for fixes

### Manual BRAIN Update (Only if Needed)

**When to manually update:**
- 🔧 After bulk corrections (fixed multiple files at once)
- 🔧 After large refactoring (want BRAIN to learn patterns immediately)
- 🚨 If automatic updates stopped working (>50 events accumulated)
- 📊 Before important routing decision (want latest knowledge)

**How to trigger manually:**
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
```

This processes all events and updates the knowledge graph.

### Standard Practice: Trust Automatic Learning

**Every KDS interaction SHOULD automatically:**
1. ✅ Log events (no user action needed)
2. ✅ Query BRAIN for insights (before routing/file decisions)
3. ✅ Update knowledge graph (periodic automatic)

**This is STANDARD KDS practice** - all agents follow this pattern automatically.

### For Advanced Users Only

**Manual intervention rarely needed, but available:**

1. **Manually correct routing** if BRAIN suggests wrong intent:
   ```markdown
   #file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md
   Wrong intent! I meant [correct interpretation]
   ```
   Error corrector logs the mistake, BRAIN learns for next time.

2. **Check BRAIN health** during self-review:
   ```markdown
   #file:KDS/prompts/user/validate.md
   Check BRAIN system health
   ```

3. **Force immediate update** after major changes:
   ```markdown
   #file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
   ```

**But in normal usage: Just use KDS and let BRAIN learn automatically!**

### First-Time Setup (Optional - BRAIN Works Out of the Box)

**KDS v5.0+ works immediately with empty BRAIN - learning starts from first use!**

**Optional bootstrapping (faster initial learning):**

**Option 1: Populate from existing sessions (if you have session history):**
```powershell
# PowerShell - Seed BRAIN from past sessions
.\KDS\scripts\populate-kds-brain.ps1

# Then update knowledge graph
#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
```

**Option 2: Crawl your codebase (recommended for new installations):**
```powershell
# PowerShell - Quick scan (30 seconds)
.\KDS\scripts\brain-crawler.ps1 -Mode quick

# OR Deep scan (5-10 minutes, comprehensive)
.\KDS\scripts\brain-crawler.ps1 -Mode deep
```

The crawler analyzes your entire application and feeds BRAIN with:
- 🏗️ Architectural patterns (where components/services/tests live)
- 🔗 File relationships (what depends on what)
- 📝 Naming conventions (how files are named)
- 🛠️ Technology stack (languages, frameworks, tools)
- 🧪 Test patterns (frameworks, test data, selectors)

**See:** `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-crawler.md` for details

**But remember: Bootstrapping is OPTIONAL - BRAIN learns automatically from first interaction!**

### Ongoing Usage - No Action Needed!

**Just use KDS normally!** BRAIN learns automatically from every interaction:
- 📝 Events logged automatically with every agent action
- 🧠 BRAIN updated automatically when 50 events accumulate
- 💡 Decisions get smarter automatically over time
- 🕷️ Optional: Run incremental crawler scans to refresh architectural knowledge

**Zero manual intervention required for continuous learning.**

**Only manual actions needed:**
1. 🚨 If automatic learning breaks (check `KDS-SELF-REVIEW-STRATEGY.md`)
2. 🔧 After bulk corrections (want immediate learning)
3. 📊 When starting new project (run crawler to learn codebase)

**99% of the time: BRAIN just works!**

### Moving KDS to Another Application

**Need to reset BRAIN for a new project?**
```powershell
# PowerShell - Soft reset (clear data, keep config)
.\KDS\scripts\brain-reset.ps1 -Mode soft

# OR Export generic patterns first, then reset
.\KDS\scripts\brain-reset.ps1 -Mode export-reset -ExportPath ".\templates\my-patterns\"

# Then crawl the new application
.\KDS\scripts\brain-crawler.ps1 -Mode deep
```

BRAIN gets amnesia (forgets old app) but keeps all logic intact!

**See:** `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-reset.md` for details
