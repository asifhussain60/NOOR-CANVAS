## 🔍 Health Checks

### 1. Build Validation
```powershell
# Run build
dotnet build SPA/NoorCanvas/NoorCanvas.csproj

# Check result
IF $LASTEXITCODE -eq 0:
  ✅ Build successful
ELSE:
  ❌ Build failed
  
# Check warnings
Parse build output for warnings
IF warnings > 0:
  ⚠️ Build succeeded with warnings
```

### 2. Test Validation
```powershell
# Run all tests
dotnet test --no-build

# Parse results
Total: X
Passed: Y
Failed: Z
Skipped: W

# Determine status
IF Failed == 0:
  IF Skipped == 0:
    ✅ All tests passed
  ELSE:
    ⚠️ Tests passed but some skipped
ELSE:
  ❌ Tests failed
```

### 3. Code Quality Validation
```powershell
# Run Roslynator analysis (if available)
dotnet roslynator analyze SPA/NoorCanvas/NoorCanvas.csproj

# Parse results
Errors: X
Warnings: Y
Info: Z

# Determine status
IF Errors > 0:
  ❌ Quality check failed
ELSE IF Warnings > 0:
  ⚠️ Quality warnings found
ELSE:
  ✅ Code quality excellent
```

### 4. Git Status Validation
```powershell
# Check working directory
git status --porcelain

# Parse output
Untracked: X files
Modified: Y files
Staged: Z files

# Check branch status
git fetch origin
git status

# Determine status
IF untracked + modified + staged == 0:
  ✅ Clean working directory
ELSE:
  ⚠️ Uncommitted changes
  
IF behind origin:
  ⚠️ Branch behind origin
```

## 🧠 Decision Trees

### Overall Status Determination
```
Run all checks
      │
      ▼
Collect results
      │
      ├─ Any ❌? → CRITICAL
      │
      ├─ Any ⚠️? → DEGRADED
      │
      └─ All ✅? → HEALTHY
```

### Build Status
```
dotnet build
      │
      ▼
Check exit code
      │
      ├─ Non-zero? → ❌ FAILED
      │

          │
          ├─ Warnings > 0? → ⚠️ SUCCESS WITH WARNINGS
          │
          └─ Warnings == 0? → ✅ SUCCESS
```

### Test Status
```
dotnet test
      │
