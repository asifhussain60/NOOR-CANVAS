# Issue-20 Test Stub

Title: Verify styled dialog replacement for browser alert/confirm usages

Status: Completed (placeholder)

Description:
- This is a placeholder test description for Issue-20. It documents the assertions that a future automated test must perform.

Assertions:
1. No direct JS `alert()` calls remain in codebase. (Static analysis)
2. All pages that previously used `alert()`/`confirm()` call `DialogService` methods instead.
3. Dialog components render and accept expected parameters (Title, Message, Type).

Notes:
- Currently a markdown placeholder. Convert to a compiled xUnit test in `Tests/` during next iteration.
