test-runner-template.ps1

CI template: run this script in CI to execute test suite.
Scaffold only: does not run any tests in this change.

Steps the CI should perform:
  1. Restore solution packages
  2. Build solution
  3. Run verify-completed-tests.ps1 to ensure all completed issues have tests
  4. Run `dotnet test` for all test projects under Tests/ (or specific test projects)
  5. If any completed-issue test fails, fail the pipeline and create/open an issue

Usage (PowerShell):
    .\test-runner-template.ps1
