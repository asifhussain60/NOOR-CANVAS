# Issue-26: Application Not Loading Despite IIS Express Running

## **Issue Summary**
**Type**: üêõ Bug - Critical  
**Priority**: üî¥ HIGH  
**Category**: Infrastructure/Server  
**Status**: Resolved with Test Harness Required  
**Date Reported**: September 12, 2025  
**Reporter**: User via "application is not loading even though iis express is running"

## **Problem Description**

### **Symptoms**
- IIS Express process shows as running (PID detected)
- Ports 9090/9091 appear to be bound but application not responding
- Browser cannot connect to https://localhost:9091 or http://localhost:9090
- Health endpoints return connection failures
- No visible error messages in terminal output

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Port Conflicts**: Previous IIS Express process terminated improperly, leaving port bindings in inconsistent state
2. **Stale Process Detection**: `Get-Process` shows IIS Express running but actual port binding may be to different process (PID 4 - System)
3. **Configuration Mismatch**: Application may start with wrong configuration or fail to bind to specified ports
4. **Certificate Issues**: HTTPS binding problems with self-signed development certificates

### **Technical Details**
```
- IIS Express PID: 30172 (detected as running)
- Port 9091 bound to PID 4 (System) instead of IIS Express
- Connection errors: "The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send"
- HTTPS certificate validation failures
```

## **Resolution Implemented**

### **Immediate Fix Applied**
```powershell
# 1. Stop all IIS Express processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*iisexpress*"} | Stop-Process -Force

# 2. Verify ports are free
netstat -ano | findstr ":909"

# 3. Clean restart with proper configuration
cd "D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA\NoorCanvas"
dotnet run --urls "https://localhost:9091;http://localhost:9090"
```

### **Verification Steps**
- ‚úÖ Application starts with proper log messages
- ‚úÖ Ports 9090 and 9091 correctly bound to dotnet process
- ‚úÖ Health endpoints responding correctly
- ‚úÖ Browser access successful
- ‚úÖ HTTPS and HTTP both functional

## **Impact Assessment**

### **User Experience Impact**
- **Severity**: HIGH - Complete application unavailability
- **Frequency**: Intermittent - Occurs after improper shutdowns or port conflicts
- **Workaround**: Manual process restart required
- **Development Productivity**: Significant - Blocks all development work

### **System Impact**
- Development workflow disruption
- Time lost in manual diagnosis
- Potential data loss if application state not properly saved
- Confusion between running process and functional application

## **Test Harness Requirements**

### **Automated Detection**
1. **Port Binding Verification**: Test actual HTTP/HTTPS connectivity, not just process existence
2. **Health Check Integration**: Automated health endpoint validation
3. **Process vs. Port Mapping**: Verify IIS Express PID matches port binding PID
4. **Certificate Validation**: Test HTTPS certificate acceptance

### **Automated Resolution**
1. **Smart Process Management**: Detect and terminate stale processes
2. **Port Conflict Resolution**: Automatically free conflicted ports
3. **Clean Restart Workflow**: Automated application restart with verification
4. **Configuration Validation**: Verify launchSettings.json and port configuration

### **Preventive Measures**
1. **Graceful Shutdown Detection**: Monitor for improper application termination
2. **Port Monitoring**: Continuous port status monitoring during development
3. **Health Check Automation**: Regular automated health checks during development
4. **Certificate Management**: Automated development certificate validation and renewal

## **Recommended Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Detection Test Harness**
```powershell
# ApplicationHealthChecker.ps1
function Test-NoorCanvasHealth {
    # Test process existence
    # Test port binding
    # Test HTTP/HTTPS connectivity
    # Test health endpoints
    # Return comprehensive status report
}
```

### **Phase 2: Auto-Resolution**
```powershell
# ApplicationRecovery.ps1  
function Repair-NoorCanvasApplication {
    # Stop stale processes
    # Clear port conflicts
    # Restart with verification
    # Validate full functionality
}
```

### **Phase 3: Prevention Integration**
```powershell
# Enhanced NC command with health monitoring
# Automatic conflict detection and resolution
# Real-time application status monitoring
```

## **Related Issues**
- Issue-23: HttpClient BaseAddress authentication failure (related configuration issues)
- Previous IIS Express startup inconsistencies
- Development environment port management challenges

## **Action Items**
1. **Create comprehensive test harness** for application health detection
2. **Integrate automated recovery** into NC command workflow
3. **Implement preventive monitoring** during development sessions
4. **Document troubleshooting guide** for similar issues
5. **Add health check automation** to development workflow

## **Testing Validation Required**
- [ ] Test harness detects all failure scenarios
- [ ] Automated recovery works in all identified cases
- [ ] Prevention measures reduce issue occurrence
- [ ] Integration with existing development workflow
- [ ] Performance impact assessment of monitoring

## **Success Criteria**
- Zero manual intervention required for similar issues
- Automated detection within 30 seconds of problem occurrence
- Automated resolution within 60 seconds
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Integration with existing NC command workflow

**Issue Status**: Ready for Test Harness Implementation  
**Next Action**: Create comprehensive ApplicationHealthChecker and AutoRecovery system  
**Estimated Implementation Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Priority**: Implement immediately to prevent development workflow disruption
