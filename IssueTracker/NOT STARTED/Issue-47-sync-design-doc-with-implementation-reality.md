# Issue-47: Sync NOOR-CANVAS-DESIGN.MD with Implementation Reality

## Issue Description
The `Workspaces/Documentation/IMPLEMENTATIONS/NOOR-CANVAS-DESIGN.MD` needs to be synchronized with the actual implementation status verified in the codebase audit (September 14, 2025).

## Implementation Reality Gaps
**Architecture Changes:**
- Design document shows outdated phase structure and completion percentages
- Missing detailed backend implementation architecture (8 controllers, 3 SignalR hubs)
- Console applications section needs update (only HostProvisioner exists, not multiple tools)
- Testing framework description needs reality alignment

**Status Misalignments:**
- Design shows phases at different completion levels than actual implementation
- Missing critical Issue-53 documentation that blocks session creation workflow
- Authentication flow descriptions need update to reflect Host-only vs. Participant gaps

## Synchronization Requirements
1. **Update Architecture Section** - Reflect actual 8 controllers, 13 models, 3 SignalR hubs
2. **Correct Phase Status** - Align with verified Phase 2 (75%) and Phase 3 (65%) completion
3. **Add Critical Issues** - Document Issue-53 as primary blocker
4. **Update Use Cases** - Remove unimplemented use cases, highlight working scenarios
5. **Tool Documentation** - Correct to show only HostProvisioner console app (not multiple tools)
6. **API Contract** - Verify endpoint documentation matches actual controller implementation

## Priority
**HIGH** - Design document serves as master specification and must reflect implementation reality

## Category
**Documentation** - Design specification synchronization

## Status
**NOT STARTED** - Requires comprehensive design document review and updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Architecture section updated with verified implementation details
- [ ] Phase completion percentages match reality-verified tracker
- [ ] Issue-53 documented as critical session creation blocker
- [ ] Console applications section reflects only HostProvisioner
- [ ] API endpoints match actual controller implementation
- [ ] Use cases align with working vs. non-working functionality
- [ ] Design document version updated to v3.1 FINAL after sync
