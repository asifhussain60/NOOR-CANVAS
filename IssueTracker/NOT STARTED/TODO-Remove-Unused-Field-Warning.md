# TODO-107: Remove Unused Field Warning

**Priority**: LOW - Code Quality
**Category**: ðŸ§¹ CLEANUP
**Created**: September 17, 2025
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

## Description
Fix CS0414 compiler warning for unused `_isConnected` field in SessionWaiting.razor.

## Background
During build of SessionWaiting.razor, received warning:
- CS0414: The field '_isConnected' is assigned but its value is never used
- Field was likely added during development but not fully implemented
- Causes build warnings that should be eliminated

## Tasks Required
1. **Review Field Usage**
   - Examine `_isConnected` field in SessionWaiting.razor
   - Determine if field should be used or removed
   - Check if field was intended for connection status display

2. **Resolution Options**
   - **Option A**: Remove unused field entirely if not needed
   - **Option B**: Implement proper usage if connection status should be displayed
   - **Option C**: Add pragma directive to suppress warning if keeping for future use

3. **Code Cleanup**
   - Choose appropriate resolution
   - Update code accordingly
   - Verify build completes without warnings

## Files Involved
- `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/SessionWaiting.razor`

## Success Criteria
- Build completes with zero warnings
- Code is clean and intentional
- No functionality is broken

## Notes
Minor cleanup task to maintain code quality standards. Should be quick to resolve once SessionWaiting.razor is reviewed.
