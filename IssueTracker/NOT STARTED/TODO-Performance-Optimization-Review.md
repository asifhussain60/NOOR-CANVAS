# TODO-102: Performance Optimization Review

**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Performance  
**Category**: Production Readiness  

## Description
Review and optimize application performance for production readiness, focusing on load times, API efficiency, and resource utilization.

## Requirements
- Analyze current application performance metrics
- Identify bottlenecks in API calls and database queries
- Optimize SignalR connection management and event handling
- Review client-side resource loading and caching strategies
- Implement performance monitoring and alerting

## Expected Deliverables
1. Performance Analysis Report with current metrics
2. Optimization recommendations and implementation plan
3. Performance monitoring dashboard configuration
4. Load testing results and capacity planning
5. Production performance standards and SLAs

## Performance Areas to Review
- [ ] API endpoint response times and query optimization
- [ ] SignalR connection scaling and resource management
- [ ] Client-side bundle size and loading optimization
- [ ] Database query performance and indexing
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation
- [ ] Memory usage and garbage collection optimization

## Tools and Metrics
- Application Insights or similar monitoring tools
- Load testing with realistic user scenarios
- Database query performance analysis
- Client-side performance profiling
- Network latency and throughput testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive performance baseline established
- [ ] Critical bottlenecks identified and resolved
- [ ] Load testing demonstrates acceptable performance under expected traffic
- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented with alerting
- [ ] Production readiness checklist completed

## Estimated Effort
8-12 hours
