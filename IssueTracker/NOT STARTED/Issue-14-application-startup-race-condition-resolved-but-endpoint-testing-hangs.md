# Issue-14: Application Startup Race Condition Resolved But Endpoint Testing Hangs

## üìã **ISSUE SUMMARY**

**Status:** Not Started ‚ùå  
**Priority:** High üî¥  
**Category:** Bug üêõ  
**Created:** September 11, 2025  
**Assigned:** GitHub Copilot

---

## üéØ **PROBLEM DESCRIPTION**

### **Primary Issue**

Application successfully starts and logs indicate it's listening on both ports (9090 HTTP, 9091 HTTPS), but HTTP endpoint testing commands hang indefinitely without response.

### **Race Condition Resolution**

- **Original Race Condition:** Multiple NoorCanvas processes running simultaneously, causing file locking
- **Root Cause:** Process PID 22088 was locking `NoorCanvas.exe` during build
- **Resolution Applied:** Killed existing processes, cleaned build output, restarted application

### **Current Symptoms**

- ‚úÖ Application builds and starts successfully
- ‚úÖ Console logs show: "Now listening on: http://localhost:9090"
- ‚úÖ Console logs show: "Now listening on: https://localhost:9091"
- ‚ùå `Invoke-WebRequest` commands hang without timeout
- ‚ùå `Test-NetConnection` commands hang without response
- ‚ùå `netstat -ano | findstr ":909"` returns empty results despite log claims

## üîç **DETAILED ANALYSIS**

### **Successful Application Startup Logs**

```
[14:18:31 INF] Now listening on: http://localhost:9090
[14:18:31 INF] Now listening on: https://localhost:9091
[14:18:31 INF] Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

### **Debugging Added to Program.cs**

- Comprehensive console debugging around startup process
- Service configuration validation logging
- URL binding verification logging
- Database connection string logging

### **Commands That Hang**

```powershell
# These commands hang indefinitely:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:9090/healthz" -UseBasicParsing
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 9090
netstat -ano | findstr ":909"
```

### **Technical Evidence**

- Launch settings override may be conflicting with command-line URL parameters
- Warning: "Overriding address(es) 'https://localhost:9091, http://localhost:9090'. Binding to endpoints defined via IConfiguration and/or UseKestrel() instead."

---

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS**

### **Launch Settings Conflict**

The application uses `launchSettings.json` which may override command-line URL parameters, causing the application to bind to different ports than specified.

### **Possible Issues**

1. **Port Binding Mismatch:** Application claims to listen on 9090/9091 but actually binds elsewhere
2. **Firewall/Security Software:** Local security software blocking port access
3. **Process Isolation:** Application running in isolated context unreachable by PowerShell commands
4. **Launch Settings Override:** `launchSettings.json` overriding URL configuration

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK**

### **Phase 1: Port Verification**

- [ ] Check actual port bindings using alternative methods
- [ ] Examine `launchSettings.json` for port conflicts
- [ ] Test without launch settings override
- [ ] Verify no firewall blocking

### **Phase 2: Configuration Analysis**

- [ ] Remove/rename `launchSettings.json` temporarily
- [ ] Test with explicit Kestrel configuration
- [ ] Verify URL binding in Program.cs without overrides
- [ ] Check IConfiguration endpoint definitions

### **Phase 3: Alternative Testing Methods**

- [ ] Use browser navigation instead of PowerShell commands
- [ ] Test with `curl` if available
- [ ] Use Process Monitor to verify actual port binding
- [ ] Check Windows Event Logs for port conflicts

---

## ‚úÖ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **Success Metrics**

- [ ] `http://localhost:9090` responds to browser requests
- [ ] `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:9090/healthz"` returns response
- [ ] `netstat -ano | findstr ":9090"` shows active binding
- [ ] Application accessible without hanging commands
- [ ] No race conditions on subsequent startups

### **Verification Steps**

1. Kill all existing processes
2. Clean build output
3. Start application with debugging
4. Verify port accessibility via multiple methods
5. Confirm endpoint responses match expected behavior

## üìù **DEBUGGING HISTORY**

### **Race Condition Discovery & Resolution**

```
File locked by: "NoorCanvas (22088)"
Solution: Stop-Process -Id 22088 -Force; dotnet clean
Result: Successful application startup with comprehensive logging
```

### **Added Debugging Infrastructure**

- Console logging for initialization phases
- Serilog structured logging validation
- Service configuration step-by-step tracking
- URL binding attempt logging
- Database connection string verification

### **Current Status Evidence**

- Application reports successful startup
- All services configured correctly
- Both HTTP/HTTPS URLs configured in app.Urls
- Kestrel override warning suggests configuration conflict

---

## üí° **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate:** Examine `launchSettings.json` for port overrides
2. **Testing:** Try browser navigation to verify actual accessibility
3. **Configuration:** Test startup without launch settings
4. **Monitoring:** Use Process Monitor for actual port binding verification
5. **Documentation:** Update startup procedures to prevent future race conditions

**Expected Resolution Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Dependencies:** Access to launchSettings.json and Kestrel configuration  
**Impact:** Blocks local development and testing workflows
