# TODO-106: SignalR Server Stability Investigation

**Priority**: HIGH - Infrastructure
**Category**: ðŸ”§ BUG INVESTIGATION
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## Description

Investigate and resolve intermittent server shutdowns and connection refusal issues that prevent SignalR testing.

## Background

During SignalR testing attempts, observed multiple issues:

- Server starts successfully and logs "Now listening on: http://localhost:9090" and "https://localhost:9091"
- Server intermittently shuts down with "Application is shutting down..." and exit code 1
- Console test client receives "No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"
- Inconsistent server process persistence between runs

## Investigation Areas

1. **Server Lifecycle Analysis**
   - Review application logs for shutdown triggers
   - Check for unhandled exceptions causing premature exit
   - Analyze startup validation sequence for failures

2. **Port Binding Issues**
   - Verify port 9090/9091 availability before startup
   - Check for port conflicts with other processes
   - Investigate HTTPS certificate binding issues

3. **SignalR Configuration**
   - Review SignalR hub registration and middleware setup
   - Check for configuration conflicts
   - Validate Hub endpoint routing

4. **Environment Factors**
   - Check Windows Defender/firewall blocking connections
   - Investigate local network configuration
   - Review process permissions and execution context

## Diagnostic Steps

1. **Log Analysis**
   - Capture complete startup and shutdown logs
   - Enable verbose logging for SignalR components
   - Monitor process lifecycle with detailed timing

2. **Network Testing**
   - Use netstat/Get-NetTCPConnection to verify listening state
   - Test HTTP vs HTTPS endpoints separately
   - Validate certificate trust for HTTPS connections

3. **Process Monitoring**
   - Monitor dotnet process stability over time
   - Check memory usage and resource constraints
   - Investigate parent/child process relationships

## Files to Review

- Application startup configuration
- SignalR hub and middleware registration
- Logging configuration
- Certificate and HTTPS setup

## Success Criteria

- Server starts and remains stable for extended periods
- Ports 9090/9091 consistently accept connections
- SignalR test clients can connect without errors
- Root cause of intermittent shutdowns identified and resolved

## Notes

Critical for completing SignalR testing and ensuring production stability.
