# Issue-19: Ambiguous Route Conflict Between Index and Landing Pages

## üìã **Issue Details**
- **Title:** Ambiguous Route Conflict Between Index and Landing Pages  
- **Priority:** High üî¥
- **Category:** Bug üêõ
- **Status:** Not Started ‚ùå
- **Created:** September 12, 2025
- **Reporter:** System Error / User Report

## üîç **Problem Description**
The Blazor application is throwing an `InvalidOperationException` due to ambiguous routing configuration. Both `Index.razor` and `Landing.razor` pages are configured to use the same empty route `''`, causing the routing system to be unable to determine which component should handle the root path.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Details**
```
InvalidOperationException: The following routes are ambiguous:
'' in 'NoorCanvas.Pages.Index'
'' in 'NoorCanvas.Pages.Landing'
```

**Full Stack Trace:**
```
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RouteTableFactory.DetectAmbiguousRoutes(TreeRouteBuilder builder)
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RouteTableFactory.Create(Dictionary<Type, string[]> templatesByHandler, IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
...
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.DeveloperExceptionPageMiddlewareImpl.Invoke(HttpContext context)
```

## üéØ **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Index.razor** has `@page "/"` directive
2. **Landing.razor** also has `@page "/"` directive  
3. Both pages are trying to claim the root route, creating a conflict
4. ASP.NET Core routing system cannot resolve which component to use

## üîß **Impact Assessment**
- **Severity:** Application Breaking
- **Affected Areas:** All navigation, application startup
- **User Experience:** Complete application failure
- **Workaround:** None - application cannot start

## üìù **Reproduction Steps**
1. Navigate to application root URL (http://localhost:9090/)
2. Application throws InvalidOperationException
3. Developer exception page displays routing conflict error
4. Application cannot proceed with normal operation

## ‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Remove route conflict between Index.razor and Landing.razor
- [ ] Establish clear routing hierarchy
- [ ] Application starts without routing errors
- [ ] All navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Root path loads appropriate default page

## üõ†Ô∏è **Resolution Approach**
1. **Identify Current Route Assignments:**
   - Check `@page` directives in both Index.razor and Landing.razor
   - Determine intended purpose of each page

2. **Resolve Route Conflict:**
   - Option A: Use Index.razor for root `/` route, assign different route to Landing.razor
   - Option B: Use Landing.razor for root `/` route, assign different route to Index.razor
   - Option C: Create new default page, move both to specific routes

3. **Update Navigation Links:**
   - Ensure NavMenu.razor links point to correct routes
   - Update any hardcoded navigation references

4. **Test Resolution:**
   - Verify application starts without errors
   - Test all navigation scenarios
   - Confirm intended page loads at root URL
