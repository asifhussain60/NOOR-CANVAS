# TODO-103: Cross-Browser Testing Protocol

**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Quality Assurance  
**Category**: Testing Standards

## Description

Establish comprehensive testing procedures for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari compatibility to ensure consistent user experience across all supported browsers.

## Requirements

- Define browser support matrix and compatibility requirements
- Create automated cross-browser testing suite
- Establish manual testing procedures for browser-specific features
- Document known browser differences and workarounds
- Implement continuous integration testing for multiple browsers

## Browser Support Matrix

| Browser | Minimum Version | Support Level | Testing Priority |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Chrome  | 90+             | Full          | Primary          |
| Firefox | 88+             | Full          | Primary          |
| Edge    | 90+             | Full          | Primary          |
| Safari  | 14+             | Core          | Secondary        |

## Expected Deliverables

1. Cross-Browser Testing Strategy Document
2. Automated Playwright test suite with multi-browser configuration
3. Manual testing checklist for browser-specific features
4. Browser compatibility documentation and known issues log
5. CI/CD pipeline integration for automated browser testing
