# Issue-25: Host Authentication Failure with Valid GUID

## 🐛 **Issue Summary**
Host authentication fails with "Authentication failed. Please try again." error when using valid Host GUID generated by the Host Provisioner tool.

## 📋 **Issue Details**
- **Priority**: 🔴 HIGH
- **Category**: 🐛 Bug
- **Reporter**: User Testing
- **Date Reported**: 2025-09-12
- **Affected Component**: Host Authentication System

## 🔍 **Problem Description**
When attempting to authenticate as a host using a valid Host GUID (`6d752e72-93a1-456c-bc2d-d27af095882a`) generated by the Host Provisioner tool, the system shows an "Authentication Error" dialog with the message "Authentication failed. Please try again."

## 📱 **Reproduction Steps**
1. Run `nc` command to generate Host GUID
2. Generate new Host GUID using interactive mode (Session ID: 218)
3. Copy generated Host GUID: `6d752e72-93a1-456c-bc2d-d27af095882a`
4. Navigate to application in browser (https://localhost:9091)
5. Click "Start Session" button under "I am a Host" section
6. Enter the Host GUID in the authentication form
7. Click "Access Dashboard" button
8. Observe "Authentication Error" dialog appears

## 🔧 **Expected Behavior**
- Host GUID should be validated successfully
- User should be redirected to host dashboard
- No authentication error should occur

## 🚨 **Actual Behavior**
- Authentication fails with generic error message
- Red error dialog appears: "Authentication Error - Authentication failed. Please try again."
- User remains on authentication form

## 🧪 **Investigation Required**
1. **Database Connection**: Verify database connectivity and schema access
2. **GUID Storage**: Check if Host GUIDs are being stored properly in database
3. **Authentication Logic**: Examine host authentication endpoint code
4. **Hash Validation**: Verify GUID hashing and validation logic
5. **API Endpoint**: Test `/api/host/authenticate` endpoint functionality

## 📊 **Technical Context**
- **Generated GUID**: `6d752e72-93a1-456c-bc2d-d27af095882a`
- **Session ID**: 218
- **Generated By**: Interactive User
- **Generated At**: 2025-09-12 19:50:01 UTC
- **Application URL**: https://localhost:9091
- **Database**: Canvas schema (KSESSIONS_DEV)

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
*To be determined during investigation*

## 💡 **Potential Solutions**
1. Verify database connection and canvas schema access
2. Check host authentication API endpoint implementation
3. Validate GUID storage and retrieval logic
4. Review authentication middleware configuration
5. Test GUID hashing algorithm consistency

## ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Host GUID authentication works successfully
- [ ] Generated GUIDs are stored in database correctly
- [ ] Authentication endpoint returns proper success/failure responses
- [ ] Error messages are meaningful and helpful
- [ ] Database queries execute without errors

## 🧪 **Test Cases**
- [ ] Test host authentication with freshly generated GUID
- [ ] Test host authentication with invalid GUID (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test database connectivity and schema access
- [ ] Test API endpoint `/api/host/authenticate` directly
- [ ] Test GUID storage and retrieval functionality
