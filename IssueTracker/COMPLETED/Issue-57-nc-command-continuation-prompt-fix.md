# Issue-57: NC Command Continuation Prompt Fix

**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Priority**: HIGH üî¥  
**Category**: Bug üêõ  
**Status**: NOT STARTED

---

## Issue Description

The `nc` command's "Press ENTER to continue..." prompt is not working correctly. Users must type "exit" instead of pressing any key to proceed to the build phase, breaking the expected workflow.

**Current Behavior:**

- After nct token generation, shows "Press ENTER to continue..."
- Pressing ENTER does not continue the workflow
- User must type "exit" to proceed to build phase
- This is counterintuitive and breaks expected user experience

**Required Behavior:**

- After nct token generation, show "Press ENTER to continue..."
- Pressing ENTER should immediately continue to build phase
- No additional text input required
- Smooth, expected workflow continuation

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Issue Location**: `Workspaces/Global/nc.ps1` line 209-211

```powershell
Write-Host "Press ENTER to continue to build..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
Read-Host
```

**Problem**: The `Read-Host` command is working correctly, but there may be an issue with how the Host Provisioner (nct) command is terminating or how the workflow continues after the prompt.

**Investigation Required**:

1. Check if nct command is properly exiting
2. Verify nc.ps1 workflow continuation logic
3. Test Read-Host functionality in PowerShell environment
4. Check for any background processes or hanging operations

---

## Technical Requirements

### Immediate Fix:

1. **Prompt Functionality**: Ensure Read-Host works as expected
2. **Workflow Continuation**: Verify script continues after user input
3. **Process Cleanup**: Ensure nct command terminates properly
4. **Error Handling**: Add debugging output to identify issue

### Testing Scenarios:

1. Run `nc` and verify prompt works with ENTER key
2. Test with different PowerShell environments
3. Verify no hanging background processes
4. Test session ID parameter variation (when Issue-56 implemented)

### Success Criteria:

- Pressing ENTER continues workflow immediately
- No "exit" text input required
- Smooth transition from token generation to build
- Consistent behavior across PowerShell environments

## Implementation Framework

**Debugging Approach:**

1. Add verbose logging around prompt area
2. Test Read-Host functionality in isolation
3. Check nct command termination behavior
4. Verify no process hangs or blocking operations

**Potential Solutions:**

1. **Enhanced Read-Host**: Add explicit prompt handling
2. **Process Verification**: Ensure nct terminates cleanly
3. **Alternative Input Methods**: Consider different prompt mechanisms if needed
4. **Timeout Handling**: Add timeout for non-responsive prompts

**Code Changes Required:**

- Debug and fix `Workspaces/Global/nc.ps1` prompt handling
- Potentially update nct command termination
- Add error handling and logging
- Test across PowerShell environments

## Priority Justification

This is marked HIGH priority because:

- Breaks basic nc command usability
- Causes user confusion and workflow disruption
- Blocks efficient development process
- Must be fixed before other nc enhancements
