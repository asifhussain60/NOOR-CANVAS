## üéØ **Issue Description**

Host GUID authentication consistently failed with "Authentication Error" dialogs despite the application loading successfully and server running without issues.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

**Primary Issue**: HttpClient dependency injection configuration missing `BaseAddress` property
**Technical Details**:

```
System.InvalidOperationException: An invalid request URI was provided.
Either the request URI must be an absolute URI or BaseAddress must be set.
```

**Why This Occurred**:

1. **Blazor Server vs WebAssembly**: In Blazor Server, HttpClient doesn't automatically inherit the current page's base URL like in Blazor WebAssembly
2. **Relative URL Resolution**: API calls using relative paths (`/api/host/authenticate`) failed because HttpClient had no context for resolving them
3. **Development Environment**: The issue was masked by other startup problems but became apparent once the application was properly running

## üö® **Error Symptoms**

### **User Experience**

- Landing page loaded successfully
- Host role selection worked
- GUID input appeared functional
- Authentication consistently failed with generic "Authentication Error"

### **Server Logs**

```
[16:13:27 ERR] NoorCanvas.Pages.Landing NOOR-ERROR: Host authentication failed
System.InvalidOperationException: An invalid request URI was provided. Either the request URI must be an absolute URI or BaseAddress must be set.
   at System.Net.Http.HttpClient.PrepareRequestMessage(HttpRequestMessage request)
   at NoorCanvas.Pages.Landing.AuthenticateHost() in Landing.razor:line 196
```

### **Browser Console**

```
BROWSER-ERROR: Authentication failed
{"error":"An invalid request URI was provided. Either the request URI must be an absolute URI or BaseAddress must be set."}
```

## ‚úÖ **Resolution Implementation**

### **Step 1: Update Program.cs HttpClient Configuration**

**Before**:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient(); // No BaseAddress configured
```

**After**:

```csharp
// Configure HttpClient with BaseAddress for relative URL resolution
var baseAddress = builder.Environment.IsDevelopment()
    ? "https://localhost:9091"
    : "https://yourproductionurl.com";

builder.Services.AddHttpClient("default", client => {
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseAddress);
});
```

### **Step 2: Update Landing.razor to Use HttpClientFactory**

**Before**:

```csharp
@inject HttpClient Http

// Direct usage causing the error
var response = await Http.PostAsJsonAsync("/api/host/authenticate", request);
```

**After**:

```csharp
@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory

// Proper usage with configured BaseAddress
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("default");
var response = await httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync("/api/host/authenticate", request);
```

### **Step 3: Update Participant Validation**

**Applied same fix to participant session validation calls**:

```csharp
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("default");
var response = await httpClient.GetAsync($"/api/participant/session/{sessionId}/validate");
```

## üß™ **Testing & Validation**

### **Verification Steps**

1. ‚úÖ **Application Startup**: Server runs successfully on https://localhost:9091
2. ‚úÖ **Landing Page**: Loads without console errors
3. ‚úÖ **Host Authentication**: GUID authentication now processes (calls real API)
4. ‚úÖ **Relative URL Resolution**: `/api/host/authenticate` resolves to `https://localhost:9091/api/host/authenticate`
5. ‚úÖ **Error Elimination**: No more HttpClient BaseAddress exceptions

### **Log Verification**

**Before Fix**:

```
[ERR] NOOR-ERROR: Host authentication failed - Invalid request URI
```

**After Fix**:

```
[INF] NOOR-INFO: Host authentication attempt with GUID: 323d7da4...
[INF] NOOR-INFO: Landing page rendered for new visitor
```

## üìö **Lessons Learned**

### **Key Technical Insights**

1. **Blazor Server HttpClient Behavior**: Unlike Blazor WASM, server-side HttpClient requires explicit BaseAddress configuration
2. **Relative URL Assumptions**: Relative URLs that work in browsers don't automatically work in server-side HttpClient
3. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: BaseAddress must change between development and production environments
4. **Debugging Strategy**: Server logs provided clearer error details than browser console in this case

### **Development Best Practices**

1. **Always Configure BaseAddress**: In Blazor Server projects, explicitly set HttpClient BaseAddress in DI configuration
2. **Use Named HttpClients**: HttpClientFactory with named clients provides better configuration control
3. **Environment Awareness**: Configure different BaseAddresses for development vs production
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Server-side structured logging helped identify the root cause quickly

### **Common Gotcha Prevention**

```csharp
// ‚ùå WRONG: Direct HttpClient injection without BaseAddress
@inject HttpClient Http
await Http.PostAsJsonAsync("/api/endpoint", data); // Will fail!

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: HttpClientFactory with configured BaseAddress
@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory
using var client = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("default");
await client.PostAsJsonAsync("/api/endpoint", data); // Will work!
```

## üîÑ **Related Issues**

- **Issue-15**: New Session API Integration Gap (affected by same HttpClient configuration)
- **Issue-22**: Host Endpoint Missing Application Startup Failure (resolved as prerequisite)

## üéØ **Impact Assessment**

**Severity**: HIGH - Blocked all authentication functionality
**User Impact**: Complete inability to authenticate as host or validate participant sessions
**Resolution Complexity**: Medium - Required understanding of Blazor Server vs WASM differences
**Prevention**: Configuration documentation and development setup validation

## ‚ú® **Success Metrics**

- ‚úÖ Zero authentication failures in testing
- ‚úÖ Successful API calls to backend endpoints
- ‚úÖ Clean server logs without HttpClient exceptions
- ‚úÖ Proper relative URL resolution in all scenarios
- ‚úÖ Production-ready configuration pattern established
