# ISSUE 80: Application Not Loading - Connection Refused Error

**Status:** ðŸ”„ NOT STARTED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Category:** Bug  
**Created:** 2024-12-19

## Issue Description

The NOOR Canvas application is not loading and showing "This site can't be reached" with "localhost refused to connect" error. The application was previously working but stopped loading after recent changes.

## Error Details

- **Browser Error**: "This site can't be reached - localhost refused to connect"
- **URL**: https://localhost:9091
- **Symptoms**: Connection refused, site completely inaccessible
- **Previous Status**: Application was working before recent changes

## Investigation Steps Needed

1. Check git history for breaking changes
2. Review application logs for startup errors
3. Verify port availability and process status
4. Check if dotnet processes are running correctly
5. Compare with previously resolved similar issues in COMPLETED folder

## Related Issues to Review

- Check COMPLETED folder for similar connection/startup issues
- Review git history for recent changes that might have broken startup
- Examine logs for detailed error information

## Debug Strategy

- Add enhanced logging to startup process
- Verify all recent changes are properly applied
- Ensure no configuration conflicts
- Check for port binding issues

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue**: PowerShell profile with global NOOR Canvas commands was automatically changing the working directory, causing `dotnet run` to execute from the wrong path.

**Evidence**:

- Terminal consistently showed "Ã¢Å“â€¦ NOOR Canvas global commands loaded: nc, nct, ncdoc"
- `dotnet run` was executing from `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS` instead of `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA\NoorCanvas`
- Error: "Couldn't find a project to run. Ensure a project exists in D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS"

## Solution Applied

**Fix**: Used full project path specification in dotnet run command:

```powershell
dotnet run --project "D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA\NoorCanvas\NoorCanvas.csproj" --urls="https://localhost:9091;http://localhost:9090"
```

**Result**:

- âœ… Application startup successful
- âœ… Listening on https://localhost:9091 and http://localhost:9090
- âœ… All validations passed: HttpClient BaseAddress, database connections
- âœ… All recent enhancements preserved and functional

## Verification Completed

1. **Application Loading**: âœ… Successfully accessible at https://localhost:9091
2. **Recent Changes Intact**: âœ… All modifications verified present:
   - Logo: NoorCanvas.png (280px height, 70% opacity)
   - Cards: 25% wider (332px min-width, 420px max-width)
   - Text: "Manage Session" instead of "Host Authentication"
   - Enhanced CSS styling and responsive design

## Additional Debug Logging Added

- Enhanced startup logging with NOOR-VALIDATION messages
- Database connection verification logging
- Detailed application startup sequence logging

## Guard Rails Implemented (Prevention System)

**Date:** September 14, 2025

To prevent Issue-80 from recurring, comprehensive guard rails have been implemented:

### 1. Issue-80 Protection Guard (`.guards\Issue-80-Protection.ps1`)

- âœ… Directory context validation before dotnet commands
- âœ… PowerShell profile interference detection
- âœ… Port availability checking
- âœ… Auto-fix capabilities for common issues
- âœ… Monitoring mode for continuous validation

### 2. Safe Dotnet Command Wrapper (`.guards\safe-dotnet.ps1`)

- âœ… Pre-execution safety validation
- âœ… Automatic project path correction
- âœ… Clear error messages with safe alternatives

### 3. Enhanced nc.ps1 Global Command Protection

- âœ… Directory validation before `Set-Location`
- âœ… Explicit project file path usage in `dotnet run`
- âœ… Fallback to absolute paths when needed
- âœ… Built-in Issue-80 protection messages

### 4. Usage Examples

```powershell
# Validate environment safety
.\.guards\Issue-80-Protection.ps1

# Safe dotnet execution
.\.guards\safe-dotnet.ps1 run --urls "https://localhost:9091;http://localhost:9090"

# Enhanced nc command (now with protection)
nc
```

### 5. Integration with VS Code Tasks

- Guard validation available as VS Code task
- Can be run as part of build process
- Strict mode for CI/CD integration
