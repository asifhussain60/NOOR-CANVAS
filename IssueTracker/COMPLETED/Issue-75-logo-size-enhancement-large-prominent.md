## 📝 **Problem Description**

The current NOOR Canvas logo needs to be significantly larger and more prominent on the landing page to create better visual hierarchy and brand presence.

## 🎯 **Requirements**

1. **Logo Size Increase**: Make the NOOR Canvas logo LARGE and stand out
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Logo should be the most prominent element on the page
3. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure logo remains crisp at larger sizes
4. **Responsive Design**: Logo should scale appropriately on different screen sizes

## 📚 **Previous Work Reference**

From Issue-65 (COMPLETED):
- Logo was previously increased from 80px to 160px height
- Current CSS class: `.noor-main-logo` with `height: 160px`
- Logo source: `images/NoorCanvas.png` (recently updated)

## 🔧 **Implementation Plan**

1. **Analyze Current Logo Size**: Review current 160px height implementation
2. **Determine New Size**: Calculate appropriate LARGE size (suggested: 240px-320px height)
3. **Update CSS Classes**: Modify `.noor-main-logo` class in `noor-canvas.css`
4. **Test Responsiveness**: Ensure logo scales properly on mobile devices
5. **Add Debug Logging**: Console logging for size changes and troubleshooting

## 💻 **Files to Modify**

- `SPA/NoorCanvas/wwwroot/css/noor-canvas.css`: Logo styling classes
- `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/Landing.razor`: Logo implementation (if needed)
- `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/CreateSession.razor`: Logo implementation (if needed)

## 🧪 **Testing Requirements**

1. **Desktop Testing**: Verify logo prominence on desktop browsers
2. **Mobile Testing**: Ensure responsive behavior on mobile devices
3. **Brand Consistency**: Confirm logo maintains brand integrity at larger size
4. **Performance Testing**: Check image loading performance

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Logo is significantly LARGER and more prominent
