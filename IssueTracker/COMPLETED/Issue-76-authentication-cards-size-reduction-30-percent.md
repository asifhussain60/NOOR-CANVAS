- **Title:** Authentication Cards Size Reduction - 30% Smaller
- **Type:** UX Enhancement 🔧
- **Priority:** HIGH 🔥
- **Status:** In Progress ⚡

## 📝 **Problem Description**

The HOST and ATTEND authentication cards need to be reduced by 30% to create better visual balance with the larger logo and improve overall page composition.

## 🎯 **Requirements**

1. **Size Reduction**: Reduce both HOST and ATTEND cards by exactly 30%
2. **Maintain Usability**: Ensure cards remain functional and accessible
3. **Visual Balance**: Cards should complement the larger logo size
4. **Preserve Functionality**: All button interactions and animations must work
5. **Responsive Design**: Maintain mobile compatibility

## 📚 **Previous Work Reference**

From Issue-65 (COMPLETED):

- Cards were previously made wider (30% increase in width)
- Current container: `noor-max-w-6xl` (72rem)
- Cards use classes like `noor-card-wide`, `noor-card-interactive`

## 🔧 **Implementation Plan**

1. **Analyze Current Card Dimensions**: Review existing CSS classes and sizing
2. **Calculate 30% Reduction**: Determine new dimensions for all card elements
3. **Update CSS Classes**: Modify card-related classes in `noor-canvas.css`
4. **Adjust Spacing**: Rebalance margins and gaps between elements
5. **Test Interactions**: Verify all card functionality remains intact
6. **Add Debug Logging**: Console logging for size changes and user interactions

## 💻 **Files to Modify**

- `SPA/NoorCanvas/wwwroot/css/noor-canvas.css`: Card sizing classes
- `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/Landing.razor`: Card implementation (if structural changes needed)
- `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/CreateSession.razor`: Consistency check

## 🎨 **CSS Classes to Update**

Based on previous work, likely classes include:

- `.noor-card-wide`: Main card styling
- `.noor-card-interactive`: Interactive card behaviors
- `.noor-flex-panel-wide`: Container for cards
- `.noor-large-button-content`: Button content areas
- `.noor-large-icon`: Icon sizing within cards

## 🧪 **Testing Requirements**

1. **Functional Testing**: All card buttons and interactions work
2. **Visual Testing**: Cards are exactly 30% smaller
3. **Responsive Testing**: Mobile and tablet compatibility
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Touch targets remain adequate for usability
5. **Animation Testing**: Any card animations or transitions still work

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Cards are exactly 30% smaller in all dimensions
- [ ] Visual balance is improved with larger logo
- [ ] All card functionality is preserved
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices
- [ ] Touch targets remain accessible (minimum 44px)

## 📐 **Calculation Notes**

For 30% reduction:

- New size = Current size × 0.7
- Example: 400px → 280px
- Padding and margins should also be reduced proportionally
