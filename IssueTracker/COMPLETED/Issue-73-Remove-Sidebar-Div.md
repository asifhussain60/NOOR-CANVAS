## Resolution Summary
Successfully removed the unnecessary `<div class="sidebar" b-6pgjmqwp39=""></div>` element from `Shared/MainLayout.razor`. Updated associated CSS in `MainLayout.razor.css` to optimize layout without sidebar constraints, enabling full-width content display and improved visual hierarchy.

## Implementation Details
- Removed empty sidebar div from MainLayout.razor
- Updated CSS to use column-based layout instead of row with sidebar
- Eliminated 250px width constraint that was pushing content to the right
- Maintained responsive design across all viewports

## Notes
This div was leftover from previous layout implementations and was causing unnecessary layout constraints. Its removal allows the main content to utilize the full viewport width effectively.
