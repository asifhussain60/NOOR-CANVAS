# Issue-11: Complete nsrun/ncrun Removal - COMPLETED ✅

**Created:** September 11, 2025  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Bug  
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Completed:** September 11, 2025

## **Problem Description**

Despite implementing Issue-10 to consolidate global commands, the terminal still showed:

```
? NOOR Canvas global commands loaded: nsrun, nc
```

This indicated that `nsrun` was still being loaded as a global command and remained functional, which defeated the purpose of the consolidation effort.

**Issues Identified:**

- `nsrun` command still appeared in global command loading message
- `nsrun` command was still functional/executable
- Physical files were not properly deleted from the system
- PowerShell profile contained nsrun function definition

## **Resolution Summary**

✅ **Complete Removal Achieved:**

### 1. Physical File Cleanup

- **Removed:** `nsrun.ps1`, `nsrun.bat` from `Workspaces/Global/`
- **Removed:** `ncrun.ps1`, `ncrun.cmd`, `ncrun-clean.ps1`, `ncrun-simple.ps1` from `Workspaces/Global/`
- **Verified:** No remaining nsrun/ncrun files in Global directory

### 2. PowerShell Profile Cleanup

- **Removed:** `nsrun` function definition from PowerShell profile
- **Removed:** `Set-Alias nc nsrun` line from profile
- **Updated:** Loading message to show only "nc" command
- **Fixed:** `nc` function to call `nc.ps1` directly using `@args` for proper parameter forwarding

### 3. Command Verification

- **Confirmed:** `nsrun` command no longer exists (throws "command not found" error)
- **Confirmed:** `ncrun` command no longer exists
- **Verified:** `nc` command works with all parameters: `-Build`, `-NoBrowser`, `-Https`, `-Test`, `-Port`, `-Help`

### 4. Functional Testing

- **✅ nc -Help:** Shows complete help documentation
- **✅ nc -Build -NoBrowser:** Builds and starts application without browser
- **✅ nc -Test:** Starts both application and testing suite
- **✅ nc -Https:** Uses HTTPS on port 9091
- **✅ nc -Port 8080:** Custom port configuration

## **Technical Implementation**

### Final PowerShell Profile Function:

```powershell
# NOOR Canvas Global Launcher
function nc {
    & "D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\Workspaces\Global\nc.ps1" @args
}

Write-Host "✅ NOOR Canvas global command loaded: nc" -ForegroundColor Green
```

### Key Features of Consolidated `nc` Command:

- **Default:** Starts NOOR Canvas on localhost:9090
- **Build Mode:** `nc -Build` - Builds before starting
- **Testing Mode:** `nc -Test` - Starts both app and test suite
- **Browser Control:** `nc -NoBrowser` - Starts without opening browser
- **HTTPS Support:** `nc -Https` - Uses HTTPS on port 9091
- **Custom Port:** `nc -Port 8080` - Uses specified port
- **Help System:** `nc -Help` - Shows complete usage documentation

## **Validation Results**

✅ **Terminal Loading Message:** Now shows only "✅ NOOR Canvas global command loaded: nc"  
✅ **nsrun Command:** Completely removed - "command not found" error  
✅ **ncrun Command:** Completely removed - "command not found" error  
✅ **nc Command:** Fully functional with all legacy nsrun/ncrun capabilities  
✅ **Physical Files:** All nsrun/ncrun files deleted from Global directory  
✅ **Profile Cleanup:** PowerShell profile contains only nc function

## **Impact Assessment**

- **Simplified:** Global command structure reduced from 3 commands to 1
- **Enhanced:** Better parameter handling with @args forwarding
- **Consolidated:** All legacy functionality preserved in single `nc` command
- **Clean:** No remnants of deprecated nsrun/ncrun commands
- **Maintainable:** Single point of maintenance for global launcher

## **Related Issues**

- **Issue-10:** Global Command Consolidation (prerequisite) ✅
- **Future:** Maintain only `nc` command for NOOR Canvas operations

---

**Status:** Issue fully resolved - complete removal and consolidation achieved.
