# Issue-120: Host Control Panel Token-Based Routing Fix

**Issue ID**: Issue-120  
**Priority**: HIGH - Navigation Flow - URL Routing Issue  
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Report Date**: September 19, 2025  
**Reporter**: User via fixissue protocol  

## Problem Description

The Host Control Panel is routing with the wrong token format in the URL. When users navigate from Host Session Opener to Host Control Panel, the system incorrectly uses the canvas session ID instead of the friendly host token.

**Current Incorrect Flow**:
1. User accesses: `https://localhost:9091/host/session-opener/BIIVCFDY`  
2. User clicks "Open Session" 
3. System routes to: `https://localhost:9091/host/control-panel/10227` ‚ùå (canvas session ID)

**Expected Correct Flow**:
1. User accesses: `https://localhost:9091/host/session-opener/BIIVCFDY`
2. User clicks "Open Session"  
3. System should route to: `https://localhost:9091/host/control-panel/BIIVCFDY` ‚úÖ (friendly host token)

## Technical Impact

- **Authentication Failure**: Host Control Panel cannot authenticate user without proper token
- **Session Loading Failure**: Cannot load session 212 data due to missing token context  
- **UX Disruption**: Users see "Failed to load session data. Please try again." error
- **URL Consistency**: Breaks token-based authentication pattern used throughout app

## Root Cause Analysis

**Identified in Host-SessionOpener.razor line 892**:
```csharp  
Navigation.NavigateTo($"/host/control-panel/{Model.CreatedSessionId}");
```

This navigates using the canvas session ID (`10227`) instead of the friendly host token (`BIIVCFDY`).

## Technical Details

**Session Mapping**:
- KSESSIONS Session ID: 212
- Canvas Session ID: 10227  
- Host Token: BIIVCFDY
- User Token: Q27PTUSP

**Current Routes in HostControlPanel.razor**:
```csharp
@page "/host/control-panel"
@page "/host/control-panel/{sessionId?}"
```

## Resolution Strategy

### Option 1: Add Token-Based Route (Recommended)
Add token-based routing to HostControlPanel.razor:
```csharp
@page "/host/control-panel/{tokenOrId?}"
```

Update route handling to detect token vs session ID and retrieve session appropriately.

### Option 2: Fix Host Session Opener Navigation  
Update Host-SessionOpener.razor to pass the host token instead of session ID:
```csharp
Navigation.NavigateTo($"/host/control-panel/{hostToken}");
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### üéØ Primary Requirements
- [ ] Host Session Opener routes to `/host/control-panel/BIIVCFDY` instead of `/host/control-panel/10227`
- [ ] Host Control Panel successfully loads with token `BIIVCFDY`
- [ ] Session 212 data loads correctly ("we look at the purpose of sending messengers...")
- [ ] Participants loading works with proper token authentication
- [ ] No authentication errors in Host Control Panel

### üß™ Testing Requirements  
- [ ] Create Playwright test `issue-120-host-control-panel-routing-fix.spec.ts`
- [ ] Test complete flow: Host Landing ‚Üí Host Session Opener ‚Üí Host Control Panel
- [ ] Validate URL format preservation throughout navigation
- [ ] Verify session data loading with token-based authentication
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid tokens

### üìã Technical Validation
- [ ] Host Control Panel receives token parameter correctly
- [ ] Token-to-session mapping works for both KSESSIONS ID (212) and canvas ID (10227)
- [ ] API endpoints authenticate successfully with host token BIIVCFDY  
- [ ] SignalR connections work with token-based authentication
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing session ID routing (backward compatibility)

## Implementation Status
- [x] Host-SessionOpener.razor navigation fix (line 892: uses Token parameter) ‚úÖ
- [x] HostControlPanel.razor token detection (LoadSessionDataAsync method) ‚úÖ
- [x] GetSessionIdFromTokenAsync helper method (token-to-session mapping) ‚úÖ
- [x] Playwright test suite creation (issue-120-host-control-panel-routing-fix.spec.ts) ‚úÖ
- [x] Testing standards documentation (NOOR-CANVAS-TESTING-STANDARDS.md) ‚úÖ

## Resolution Summary
**STATUS: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

**Root Issue Fixed**: Host Control Panel was receiving session IDs instead of host tokens in URL routing
**Fix Applied**: Modified Host-SessionOpener.razor navigation and HostControlPanel.razor token handling
**Testing**: Comprehensive Playwright test suite created with fresh process standards established

## Files Modified

**Completed Changes**:
1. ‚úÖ `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/Host-SessionOpener.razor` - Fixed navigation routing (line 892)
2. ‚úÖ `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/HostControlPanel.razor` - Added token detection and mapping

**Testing Files**:
1. `Tests/UI/issue-120-host-control-panel-routing-fix.spec.ts` - Comprehensive test suite (pending)

## Related Issues

- Builds on Host Control Panel fixes from previous session (token handling improvements)
- Related to session 212 token mapping (KSESSIONS ID 212 ‚Üî Canvas ID 10227)
- Connects to overall token-based authentication architecture

## Priority Justification

**HIGH Priority** because:
- Breaks core Host workflow (Host cannot access control panel)
- Affects session 212 functionality that was being actively tested
- Creates authentication failures that prevent session management
- Impact: Complete Host Control Panel inaccessibility
