# Issue-113: SessionWaiting Page Loading Blank Due to HttpClient BaseAddress Configuration

**Priority**: HIGH - UI/UX Critical - Page Not Loading  
**Status**: RESOLVED - September 18, 2025  
**Report Date**: September 18, 2025

## **Problem Description**
✅ **RESOLVED**: SessionWaiting page at `/session/waiting/{token}` was loading completely blank instead of showing the waiting room interface. Root cause identified as missing HttpClient BaseAddress configuration in SessionWaiting.razor component, causing "An invalid request URI was provided. Either the request URI must be an absolute URI or BaseAddress must be set" exceptions during API calls to session validation endpoints.

## **Technical Impact**
- Complete failure of SessionWaiting page functionality
- Participants unable to access waiting room interface
- API calls failing silently causing blank page rendering
- User experience severely degraded for session participants

## **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was caused by missing HttpClient BaseAddress configuration in SessionWaiting.razor. When the component attempted to make API calls to validate session tokens, the HttpClient would throw exceptions because no base address was configured, causing the page to render blank without any visible error messages.

## **Resolution Implemented** ✅
1. **HttpClient BaseAddress Configuration**: Added `httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:9091/")` to both HttpClient instances in SessionWaiting.razor
2. **API Call Fixes**: Updated LoadSessionDataAsync (line 312) and LoadParticipantsAsync (line 400) methods with proper BaseAddress
3. **UI Styling Enhancement**: Updated SessionWaiting component styling to match WaitingRoom_Mock.html design with golden theme, proper spacing, and responsive layout
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created issue-113-sessionwaiting-blank-page.spec.ts Playwright test suite covering:
   - Blank page prevention validation
   - API integration verification 
   - Error handling for 404 responses
   - Responsive design testing
   - Performance impact assessment

## **Files Modified**
- `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/SessionWaiting.razor` - HttpClient BaseAddress fix and UI styling improvements
- `Tests/UI/issue-113-sessionwaiting-blank-page.spec.ts` - Comprehensive test coverage for fix validation

## **Testing Results** ✅
- SessionWaiting page now loads correctly without blank screen
- API calls to `/api/participant/session/{token}/validate` working properly
- Proper error handling for invalid tokens (404 responses expected)
- UI displays professional waiting room interface with NOOR Canvas branding
- All responsive design breakpoints functioning correctly

## **Validation Commands**
```bash
# Test the specific Issue-113 fix
cd "Tests/UI"
npx playwright test issue-113-sessionwaiting-blank-page.spec.ts

# Verify SessionWaiting page loads
# Navigate to: https://localhost:9091/session/waiting/SUAT3XWK
```

## **Prevention Measures**
- Added HttpClient BaseAddress validation in component initialization
- Enhanced error logging for API call failures
- Implemented graceful degradation for network connectivity issues
