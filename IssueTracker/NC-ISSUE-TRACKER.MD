- ✅ **Real-time System**: SignalR configuration planned
- ✅ **Issue Tracking**: Professional tracking system initialized

### **Next Steps**
1. **Phase 1 Kickoff**: Start foundation development (Week 1)
2. **First Issues**: Begin logging development challenges and requirements
3. **Team Coordination**: Use issue tracker for development team communication
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track implementation against 20-week timeline

---

## � **DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

### **Project Integration**
- **Main Design Document**: `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\Workspaces\Documentation\IMPLEMENTATIONS\NOOR-CANVAS-DESIGN.MD`
- **Development Timeline**: 20-week phased implementation
- **Technology Stack**: ASP.NET Core 8.0, Entity Framework, SignalR, McBeatch theme
- **Database**: SQL Server with "canvas" schema + "dbo" read access

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Issue Tracker Rules**

**This organizational structure is FIXED and must be maintained:**

1. **SINGLE TRACKER FILE**: Only `NC-ISSUE-TRACKER.MD` exists - no duplicates, no renames
2. **TWO FOLDERS ONLY**: `COMPLETED/` and `NOT STARTED/` - no additional subfolders  
3. **STANDARDIZED LINKS**: All issue files must link to `../NC-ISSUE-TRACKER.MD`
4. **CLEAN REPOSITORY**: Maintain organized structure throughout development
5. **NO DUPLICATE FILES**: One authoritative source per issue

**Rationale**: This structure provides clear organization, prevents file duplication, and maintains clean project state throughout 20-week development cycle.
