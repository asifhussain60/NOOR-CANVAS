## 🚀 **QUICK COMMANDS**

### **Add New Issue**
```
Add an issue: [Title] - [Description] - [High/Medium/Low] - [Bug/Feature/Enhancement/Documentation]
```
**Format:** `- ❌ **[Issue-X](NOT STARTED/Issue-X-brief-description.md)** — Brief description ❌`

### **Update Issue Status**
```
Mark issue X as [In Progress|AwaitingConfirmation|Completed|Not Started]
```
**Icons:** ❌ Not Started | ⚡ In Progress | ⏳ Awaiting Confirmation | ✅ Completed

### **Awaiting Confirmation Workflow**
- When a fix is implemented by a developer, move the issue file to `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION/` and update the tracker entry to use the ⏳ icon.
- Do NOT move issues directly to `COMPLETED/` without explicit user verification.
- The user (or an assigned verifier) must confirm the behavior in the running application. Once verified, update the tracker to move the file to `COMPLETED/` and change the icon to ✅.

### **Remove Issue**
```
Remove issue X
```
