## 🤖 **COPILOT GUIDANCE**

### **How to Use This System**

1. **Add New Issues**: Use command `Add an issue: [Title] - [Description] - [Priority: High|Medium|Low] - [Category: Bug|Feature|Enhancement|Documentation]`
2. **Update Status**: Use command `Mark issue X as [Completed|Pending|In Progress]`
3. **Remove Issues**: Use command `Remove issue X`
4. **Quick Status**: Review the status summary above for current project state

### **Issue Management Workflow**

#### **For New Issues:**
- **Create Command**: `Add an issue: SignalR connection drops - Users experiencing disconnections during long sessions - High - Bug`
- **Auto-Generated**: System creates detailed file in `NOT STARTED/` folder with ID `Issue X`
- **Status Tracking**: Issues automatically appear in appropriate status sections
- **File Format**: `Issue-X-brief-description.md` following KSESSIONS pattern

#### **For Status Updates:**
- **Progress Command**: `Mark issue 1 as In Progress` (moves file to appropriate section)
- **Complete Command**: `Mark issue 1 as Completed` (moves to COMPLETED folder)
- **Cross-References**: Use issue IDs in commits and documentation (e.g., "Fixes Issue 1")

#### **For Issue Removal:**
- **Delete Command**: `Remove issue 1` (permanently removes issue file and updates tracker)

### **Priority Guidelines**

#### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY** - Blocks development or critical functionality
- Database connection issues
- SignalR connectivity problems  
- Authentication/session management failures
- Production deployment blockers

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Important but not blocking
- Performance optimization needs
- UI/UX improvements
- Feature enhancements
- Integration issues

#### 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY** - Nice to have, cosmetic improvements
- Documentation updates
- Code cleanup
- Minor UI tweaks
- Non-critical optimizations

## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION READINESS**

### **Ready for Development**
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 structure planned
- ✅ **Database Design**: Canvas schema with cross-application access
- ✅ **Theme Integration**: McBeatch styling framework ready
- ✅ **Real-time System**: SignalR configuration planned
- ✅ **Issue Tracking**: Professional tracking system initialized

### **Next Steps**
1. **Phase 1 Kickoff**: Start foundation development (Week 1)
2. **First Issues**: Begin logging development challenges and requirements
3. **Team Coordination**: Use issue tracker for development team communication
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track implementation against 20-week timeline

---

## � **DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

### **Project Integration**
- **Main Design Document**: `D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\Workspaces\Documentation\IMPLEMENTATIONS\NOOR-CANVAS-DESIGN.MD`
- **Development Timeline**: 20-week phased implementation
- **Technology Stack**: ASP.NET Core 8.0, Entity Framework, SignalR, McBeatch theme
- **Database**: SQL Server with "canvas" schema + "dbo" read access

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Issue Tracker Rules**

**This organizational structure is FIXED and must be maintained:**

1. **SINGLE TRACKER FILE**: Only `NC-ISSUE-TRACKER.MD` exists - no duplicates, no renames
2. **TWO FOLDERS ONLY**: `COMPLETED/` and `NOT STARTED/` - no additional subfolders  
3. **STANDARDIZED LINKS**: All issue files must link to `../NC-ISSUE-TRACKER.MD`
4. **CLEAN REPOSITORY**: Maintain organized structure throughout development
5. **NO DUPLICATE FILES**: One authoritative source per issue

**Rationale**: This structure provides clear organization, prevents file duplication, and maintains clean project state throughout 20-week development cycle.
