## 🎨 **PRIORITY SYSTEM**

### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY** - Blocks development or critical functionality

**Criteria:**

- Prevents development team from proceeding
- Breaks core functionality (sessions, annotations, real-time features)
- Production deployment blockers
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss potential

**Examples:**

- Database connection failures
- SignalR hub registration issues
- Authentication system failures
- IIS deployment configuration problems

### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Important but not blocking

**Criteria:**

- Affects user experience but doesn't break core features
- Performance issues that impact usability
- Feature gaps that limit functionality
- Integration challenges

**Examples:**

- Mobile interface optimization needs
- McBeatch theme styling inconsistencies
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Cross-application integration issues

### 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY** - Nice to have, cosmetic improvements

**Criteria:**

- Cosmetic improvements
- Code cleanup and refactoring
- Documentation enhancements
- Minor UI/UX tweaks

**Examples:**

- CSS styling refinements
- Code documentation improvements
- Minor accessibility enhancements
- Performance micro-optimizations

## 📁 **FILE ORGANIZATION SYSTEM**

### **Automated File Management**

- **Issue Creation**: Creates `Issue-X-brief-description.md` in `NOT STARTED/` folder
- **Status Changes**: Automatically moves files between folders based on status
- **File Naming**: Sequential numbering (Issue 1, Issue 2, Issue 3...)
- **Cross-References**: All files link back to main tracker

### **Folder Structure**

```
