# Issue-33: Port 9091 Access Denied - IIS Express Process Conflict

## üìã **Issue Details**
- **Issue ID:** Issue-33
- **Title:** Port 9091 Access Denied - IIS Express Process Conflict
- **Type:** Bug üêõ
- **Priority:** High üî¥
- **Status:** ‚è≥ Awaiting User Confirmation - FIXED
- **Created:** September 13, 2025
- **Fixed:** September 13, 2025
- **Reporter:** Development Team
- **Assignee:** Development Team

## üéØ **Problem Statement**
Application fails to start with "SocketException (10013): An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions" when trying to bind to https://localhost:9091. This indicates another process (likely IIS Express from previous sessions) is already occupying the port.

## üìù **Detailed Description**
**Error Details:**
```
System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (10013): An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
Failed to bind to address https://localhost:9091.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Previous IIS Express instances remain running after nc command execution
- Port 9091 is still bound by orphaned IIS Express processes
- Application cannot start because port is already in use

**Impact:**
- Application cannot start for manual testing
- Development workflow blocked
- Requires manual process termination between sessions

## üîç **Investigation Required**
1. **Identify running processes on port 9091**
2. **Check for orphaned IIS Express instances** 
3. **Verify nc command process cleanup**
4. **Review process termination in global scripts**

## üèóÔ∏è **Resolution Steps**
1. **Stop all IIS Express processes**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process -Name "iisexpress*" | Stop-Process -Force
   ```

2. **Kill processes using port 9091**:
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr ":9091"
   # Then stop specific PID
   ```

3. **Update nc command to cleanup previous sessions**
4. **Add automatic process cleanup to development workflow**

## ‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Application starts successfully without port conflicts
- [ ] Previous IIS Express processes are terminated properly
- [ ] nc command includes cleanup of existing processes
- [ ] Port 9091 is available for new application instances

## üìä **Immediate Fix Commands**
```powershell
# Stop all IIS Express processes
Get-Process -Name "*iisexpress*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# Check port usage
netstat -ano | findstr ":9091"

# Start application after cleanup
dotnet run
```

**Status History:**
- **2025-09-13:** Issue identified during manual testing - socket access permissions error on port 9091
- **2025-09-13:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Terminated conflicting IIS Express processes and application started successfully

## ‚úÖ **Resolution Summary**
**Root Cause:** Orphaned IIS Express processes from previous `nc` command sessions were still occupying port 9091, preventing new application instances from binding to the port.

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Stopped all IIS Express processes:** `Get-Process -Name "*iisexpress*" | Stop-Process -Force`
2. **Verified port availability:** `netstat -ano | findstr ":9091"` showed no conflicts
3. **Restarted application:** `dotnet run` succeeded without errors

**Verification:**
- Application starts successfully on both ports (HTTP 9090, HTTPS 9091)
- No socket access permission errors
- Application log shows proper binding: "Now listening on: https://localhost:9091"
- Ready for manual testing of new HostSessionManager component

**Prevention:**
Future nc command sessions should include automatic cleanup of previous IIS Express processes to prevent this conflict.
