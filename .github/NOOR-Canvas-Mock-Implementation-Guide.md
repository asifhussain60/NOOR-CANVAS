- This is the authoritative design system: colors, typography, spacing, layouts, RTL.
- For any UI work, follow this first; aim for ≥95% pixel accuracy.
- If implementation conflicts with code, prefer this guide and propose a fix.

**Contents to keep current**
- Color tokens (e.g., #3B82F6, #5cf6beff), font (Inter), spacing scale (8/16/24/32)
- Component patterns: cards, headers, panels (logo must be inside card containers)
