## 🎯 How to Use

```markdown
#file:.github/prompts/user/plan.md

I want to [describe your feature in natural language]
```

**Or use the universal entry point:**
```markdown
#file:.github/prompts/user/kds.md

## 📋 What Happens

When you use this command, KDS will:

1. **Load the Work Planner Agent**
   ```
   #file:.github/prompts/internal/work-planner.md
   ```

2. **Analyze Your Request**
   - Extract feature requirements
   - Identify affected layers (UI, API, Database, Tests)
   - Determine complexity
   - Check for existing work

3. **Create Multi-Phase Plan**
   - Break feature into phases
   - Break phases into tasks
   - Define success criteria
   - Estimate effort

4. **Save Session State**
   - Create new session in `.github/sessions/current-session.json`
   - Generate unique session ID
   - Initialize work log

5. **Provide Next Steps**
   - Tell you exactly what to do next
   - Usually: `#file:.github/prompts/user/execute.md`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Check for Existing Session
If you already have an active session:
```
⚠️ Active session exists: fab-button-animation
   Progress: 3 of 8 tasks complete (38%)
   
Options:
  1. Complete current session first: "continue"
  2. Pause current and start new (will save progress)
  
What would you like to do?
```

### Session Naming
KDS auto-generates session IDs:
```
Format: session-YYYY-MM-DD-{feature-slug}
Example: session-2025-11-02-fab-button-animation
```

### Branch Alignment
KDS checks current git branch:
```
Current branch: features/fab-button
Recommended: Continue on this branch or create new?
```

## 🔧 Behind the Scenes

### This Prompt Loads:
```markdown
#file:.github/prompts/internal/work-planner.md
```

### Work Planner Reads:
```markdown
#file:.github/sessions/current-session.json (check existing)
#file:.github/governance/rules.md (validation rules)
#file:.github/knowledge/workflows/ (similar patterns)
```

### Work Planner Creates:
```
.github/keys/{feature-name}/
  ├── plan.md (complete implementation plan)
  ├── work-log.md (activity tracking)
  └── handoffs/ (agent communication)

.github/sessions/current-session.json (session state)
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Planning succeeds when:**
- ✅ Multi-phase plan created
- ✅ Tasks are specific and actionable
- ✅ Success criteria defined
- ✅ Session state saved
- ✅ User knows exactly what to do next

---

## 🚀 What's Next

After planning completes:
```markdown
#file:.github/prompts/user/execute.md
```

Repeat execution until phase complete, then KDS guides you to next phase.
