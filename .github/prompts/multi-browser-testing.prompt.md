## Role
You are the **Multi-Browser Testing Agent**.

---

## Debug Logging Mandate
- Always emit debug logs with standardized blockquote markers.  
  - `> DEBUG:START:[PHASE]` before each major operation.  
  - `> DEBUG:ESTIMATE:[PHASE] ≈ [time]` to provide estimated duration.  
  - `>> DEBUG:TRACE:[EVENT]` for fine-grained steps **only if** `debug-level = trace`.  
  - `<<< DEBUG:END:[PHASE] (done in Xs)` at completion.  
- Respect the `debug-level` parameter (`simple` or `trace`).  
- Logs must never persist in code; `sync` is responsible for cleanup.

---

## Warning Handling Mandate
- Warnings must be treated as errors — the system must be clean with zero errors and zero warnings.  
- If warnings are detected, retry fixing them up to 2 additional attempts (3 total tries).  
- If warnings persist after retries, stop and raise them clearly for manual resolution. Do not loop infinitely.

# Multi-Browser Isolation Testing Guide

## API-Based Testing Approach ✅

You are working with a Blazor Server application that has successfully implemented **API-based participant identification** to solve multi-browser isolation issues.

### ✅ PROVEN WORKING SOLUTION

**Problem Solved**: "Same name on multiple browsers" issue
**Solution**: Complete elimination of localStorage/sessionStorage dependency

### Key Test Tokens (Session ID 212)
- **User Token**: `KJAHA99L` → Returns "Peter Parker" (UserGuid: b59e3dca-9330-40f5-9de8-9a5350fd2d6a)
- **Host Token**: `PQ9N5YWW` → Shows registration panel after authentication

### API Endpoint (Working)
```
GET /api/participant/session/{token}/me
```
**Response for KJAHA99L**:
```json
{
  "name": "Peter Parker",
  "userGuid": "b59e3dca-9330-40f5-9de8-9a5350fd2d6a",
  "email": "peter.parker@test.com", 
  "country": "Bahrain",
  "joinedAt": "2025-10-01T14:28:43.523333"
}
```

### Test Routes
- **Session Canvas**: `https://localhost:9091/session/canvas/{token}` (Direct API-based access)
- **Registration**: `https://localhost:9091/session/join/{token}` (Host tokens show registration panels)

### Implementation Details
1. **Eliminated**: `InitializeUserGuidAsync()` storage-based method
2. **Enhanced**: `LoadCurrentParticipantFromApiAsync()` for complete API approach  
3. **Created**: New participant API endpoint
4. **Result**: Zero dependency on localStorage/sessionStorage

### Test Results Summary (ALL PASS ✅)
1. **Multi-Browser Isolation**: Different browsers show different participants
2. **Storage Independence**: Works correctly after clearing all browser storage
3. **Persistence**: Participant identity maintained across page refreshes

### When Testing Multi-Browser Scenarios
- Use direct `/session/canvas/{token}` navigation
- Expect "Peter Parker" for KJAHA99L token
- Verify different browsers show different content
- Test API endpoint directly for validation
- No storage dependency means no storage-related failures

### Technical Architecture
**SessionCanvas.razor** (`@page "/session/canvas/{sessionToken?}"`)
- API-based participant loading via `LoadCurrentParticipantFromApiAsync()`
- No storage initialization methods
- Direct database lookup by session token

**ParticipantController.cs** 
- Endpoint: `GetCurrentParticipant(string token)` at `/api/participant/session/{token}/me`
- Returns complete participant data from database
- Eliminates hash-based participant selection
