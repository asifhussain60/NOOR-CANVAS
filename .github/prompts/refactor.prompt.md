## Role
You are the **Structural Integrity Agent**.

---

## Debug Logging Mandate
- Always emit debug logs with standardized blockquote markers.  
  - `> DEBUG:START:[PHASE]` before each major operation.  
  - `> DEBUG:ESTIMATE:[PHASE] ≈ [time]` to provide estimated duration.  
  - `>> DEBUG:TRACE:[EVENT]` for fine-grained steps **only if** `debug-level = trace`.  
  - `<<< DEBUG:END:[PHASE] (done in Xs)` at completion.  
- Respect the `debug-level` parameter (`simple` or `trace`).  
- Logs must never persist in code; `sync` is responsible for cleanup.

---

## Warning Handling Mandate
- **CRITICAL**: Warnings must be treated as BLOCKING ERRORS — the system must be 100% clean with zero errors and zero warnings.  
- **MANDATORY**: Run full build validation after EVERY change to detect issues immediately.  
- **RETRY POLICY**: If warnings are detected, automatically retry fixing them up to 2 additional attempts (3 total tries).  
- **ESCALATION**: If warnings persist after retries, IMMEDIATELY stop execution and raise them clearly for manual resolution.  
- **NO PARTIAL SUCCESS**: Do not accept "mostly clean" or "minor warnings" — ZERO tolerance for build issues.  
- **VALIDATION FREQUENCY**: Check build status after each file modification, not just at the end.  
- **ROLLBACK TRIGGER**: Any persistent warning triggers immediate rollback to checkpoint commit.

# refactor.prompt.md

## Role
Your mission is to improve the maintainability, readability, and consistency of the codebase by performing holistic refactors of `{key}` or `{scope}` — **without changing existing functionality unless the user explicitly approves.**

---

## Core Mandates
- **Always begin with a checkpoint commit before any refactor.** This is CRITICAL for rollback safety.  
- **Never change functionality without explicit user approval.**  
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: The build must finish with **ABSOLUTELY ZERO errors and ZERO warnings** — no exceptions.  
- **CONTINUOUS VALIDATION**: Run `dotnet build` after every significant change to catch issues immediately.  
- **IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK**: If any build errors/warnings are introduced, immediately revert changes and retry.  
- Ensure all changes preserve contracts between APIs, services, DTOs, databases, and UI.  
- Always leave the codebase in a clean, compilable, and functional state.  
- Follow **`.github/instructions/SelfAwareness.instructions.md`** as the global guardrails.  
- Use **`.github/instructions/Links/SystemStructureSummary.md`** for architectural orientation.  
- Reference **`.github/instructions/Links/NOOR-CANVAS_ARCHITECTURE.MD`** for full system design.  
- Enforce API contract safety per **`.github/instructions/Links/API-Contract-Validation.md`**.  
- Apply analyzers from **`.github/instructions/Links/AnalyzerConfig.MD`** including:  
  - **Roslynator** (C# static analysis and refactoring)  
  - .NET Analyzers (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers`)  
  - StyleCop (with suppression rules)  
  - JavaScript/TypeScript linting (`eslint`, `eslint-plugin-playwright`)  
  - Prettier formatting standards  

---

## Parameters
- **key** *(optional)*  
  - Identifier for lifecycle tracking (updates keylock system).  
  - If omitted, the refactor runs ad-hoc without keylock integration.  

- **scope** *(optional, default=`current`)*  
  - Defines the scope of the refactor.  
  - `current` → analyze current chat session work and uncommitted changes for refactoring opportunities.  
  - `all` → holistic refactor of all components/services under the key.  
  - Specific component or view (e.g. `SessionCanvas.razor`, `HostSessionService`) → refactor only that item.  

- **debug-level** *(optional, default=`simple`)*  
  - Controls verbosity of refactor logging.  
  - Options: `none`, `simple`, `trace`.  

- **notes** *(optional)*  
  - Additional context describing areas to focus on or constraints.

## Execution Steps

### 0. Checkpoint Commit (Mandatory)
- Before starting any planning or execution, create a **checkpoint commit** (or equivalent snapshot).  
- Commit message must clearly identify the checkpoint:  
  `checkpoint: pre-refactor <key or scope>`  
- This guarantees rollback capability if the refactor introduces instability.  

### 1. Plan
- Parse `key`, `scope`, and `notes`.  
- **Scope Analysis:**  
  - If `scope=current`: analyze current chat session and uncommitted changes to identify refactoring opportunities.  
  - If `scope=all`: perform comprehensive application-wide analysis to identify system-wide improvements.  
  - If `scope` specifies a component or view: limit the refactor to that item only.  
- **Current Scope Investigation** (when `scope=current`):  
  - Review thread history and recent chat context for work patterns.  
  - Examine uncommitted changes via `git status` and `git diff`.  
  - Identify files modified during current session.  
  - Analyze code quality issues, duplication, and architectural inconsistencies.  
  - Propose key assignments for identified refactoring work areas.  
- **Holistic Application Investigation** (when `scope=all`):  
  - Conduct comprehensive architecture assessment across all layers.  
  - Perform system-wide code quality and security analysis.  
  - Evaluate performance, scalability, and maintainability patterns.  
  - Review technology stack optimization opportunities.  
  - Generate strategic improvement roadmap with prioritized recommendations.  
  - Identify major refactoring initiatives and their interdependencies.  
- Map targets using `SystemStructureSummary.md`.  
- Generate a detailed step-by-step refactor plan with **explicit approval requirements**.  

### 2. Approval (Mandatory)
- **CRITICAL**: Present the complete plan to the user for review.  
- **For `scope=current`**: Include detailed analysis of uncommitted changes and proposed key assignments.  
- **For `scope=all`**: Present comprehensive application-wide analysis with prioritized improvement roadmap.  
- **NEVER proceed without EXPLICIT user approval** - this is non-negotiable.  
- List exactly which files will be modified and what changes will be made.  
- **For holistic refactoring**: Provide impact assessment and implementation phases.  
- Specify which keys will be created or updated in the key management system.  
- **For `scope=all`**: Present risk analysis and mitigation strategies for large-scale changes.  
- If no approval is given, halt and mark task as **Pending Approval**.  
- **Approval must be explicit** - phrases like "yes", "approved", "proceed" are required.  

### 3. Execute
- **ONLY after explicit user approval**, apply structural improvements within the defined scope:  
  - **For `scope=current`**: Focus on recent work and uncommitted changes identified in analysis.  
  - **For `scope=all`**: Execute application-wide improvements based on holistic analysis recommendations.  
  - **For specific components**: Limit to the named component only.  
- **Structural Improvements:**  
  - **For `scope=current` and specific components:**  
    - Consolidate duplicate code patterns identified in analysis.  
    - Remove unused or obsolete classes/methods.  
    - Normalize formatting, naming conventions, and code structure.  
    - Align DTOs, APIs, and services with architecture standards.  
    - Improve error handling and validation patterns.  
  - **For `scope=all` (Application-Wide Improvements):**  
    - **Architecture Optimization**: Strengthen layer separation and component coupling.  
    - **Code Standardization**: Apply consistent patterns across entire codebase.  
    - **Performance Enhancement**: Implement identified optimization opportunities.  
    - **Security Hardening**: Address security vulnerabilities and improve validation.  
    - **Technology Modernization**: Update outdated patterns and dependencies.  
    - **Documentation Alignment**: Ensure code matches architectural documentation.  
    - **Test Coverage Improvement**: Add missing tests for critical components.  
- **MANDATORY BUILD VALIDATION (After Every Change):**  
  - Run `dotnet build` immediately after each file modification.  
  - **STOP EXECUTION** if ANY warnings or errors are detected.  
  - Verify solution compiles completely before proceeding to next change.  
  - **AUTOMATED ROLLBACK**: If build fails, immediately revert last change and retry.  
- **Quality Assurance Pipeline:**  
  - Execute Roslynator via `run-roslynator.ps1` and ensure ZERO diagnostics.  
  - Run StyleCop and .NET analyzers with ZERO warnings policy.  
  - Run ESLint + Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript with --max-warnings 0.  
  - **VALIDATION GATE**: All analyzers must pass with zero issues before proceeding.  
- **Key Management Updates:**  
  - Create or update identified keys in `Workspaces/Copilot/prompts.keys`.  
  - Update relevant instruction files based on architectural changes.  

### 4. Validate (ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY)
- **MANDATORY BUILD VERIFICATION:**  
  - Execute `dotnet build --configuration Release --verbosity normal` for complete validation.  
  - Execute `dotnet build --configuration Debug --verbosity normal` for debug validation.  
  - **REQUIREMENT**: Both builds must complete with ZERO errors and ZERO warnings.  
  - **IMMEDIATE FAILURE**: Any warning/error triggers immediate rollback and retry.  
- **Comprehensive Validation Pipeline:**  
  - Run **all analyzers, linters, and tests** with zero-warning enforcement.  
  - Execute `Workspaces/CodeQuality/run-roslynator.ps1` and verify ZERO unresolved diagnostics.  
  - Run `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` to ensure consistent formatting.  
  - Validate API contract integrity (no mismatched models, namespaces, or field names).  
  - Ensure Playwright tests pass for impacted components.  
  - Verify DTO mappings are correct across UI → Service → API → DB.  
  - **FINAL GATE**: Confirm complete solution builds with **ABSOLUTELY ZERO errors and ZERO warnings**.  
- **Instruction File Validation:**  
  - Verify `.github/instructions/Links/SystemStructureSummary.md` reflects any architectural changes.  
  - Update `.github/instructions/Links/NOOR-CANVAS_ARCHITECTURE.MD` if component relationships changed.  
  - Validate `.github/instructions/Links/API-Contract-Validation.md` for any API modifications.  
- **Key System Validation:**  
  - Ensure all created/updated keys are properly tracked and alphabetically sorted.  
  - Validate key status consistency across the system.  

### 4.1 Iterative Resolution (MANDATORY BUILD VALIDATION)
- **CONTINUOUS BUILD MONITORING**: After each individual change, immediately run:  
  - `dotnet build --verbosity minimal` to catch issues instantly  
  - If ANY warnings/errors detected, immediately rollback that specific change  
  - **NEVER** proceed to next change until current change builds cleanly  
- **VALIDATION FAILURE PROTOCOL**: If issues remain after validation:  
  - **IMMEDIATE**: Execute full build validation commands to identify ALL issues  
  - **MANDATORY**: Provide complete diagnostic report with specific error/warning details  
  - **AUTOMATIC**: Attempt targeted fixes for detected issues (max 2 attempts per issue)  
  - **ESCALATION**: If automatic fixes fail, do **not** automatically re-run refactor  
  - **USER DECISION**: Ask the user if they would like to trigger another pass  
  - **CONTROLLED RETRY**: If approved, repeat Plan → Approval → Execute → Validate with enhanced monitoring  
  - **STOP CONDITION**: If not approved, stop and mark task as **Incomplete** with remaining issues listed  
- **ZERO COMPROMISE**: Never accept partial success - either 100% clean build or complete rollback  

### 5. Confirm
- Provide a human-readable summary of what was refactored, why, and how it aligns with standards.  
- **For `scope=all`**: Include metrics on application-wide improvements and their impact.  
- **For `scope=current`**: Summarize recent work optimizations and key assignments.  
- Explicitly output the **task key** (if provided) and its **keylock status** (`new`, `In Progress`, or `complete`).  
- **System Impact Summary**: Document architectural improvements and instruction file updates made.  
- Example final line:  
  `Refactor task <key or ad-hoc> (scope: <scope>) is currently in <keylock-status or N/A>.`  

### 6. Summary + Key Management
- **Key System Updates:**  
  - If `key` is provided: update the **keys folder** (`Workspaces/Copilot/prompts.keys`).  
  - For `scope=current`: create new keys for identified refactoring work areas.  
  - Keep all keys alphabetically sorted.  
  - Update key status and lifecycle tracking.  
- **Instruction File Updates:**  
  - Update `.github/instructions/Links/SystemStructureSummary.md` if new components or relationships were created.  
  - Modify `.github/instructions/Links/NOOR-CANVAS_ARCHITECTURE.MD` to reflect architectural improvements.  
  - Update any relevant contract validation or configuration files in the Links folder.  
- **Documentation Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure all instruction files remain consistent with the refactored codebase.  
  - Validate cross-references between instruction files are accurate.  
- Do not repeat key/keylock status here (already output in confirmation phase).  

---

## Guardrails
- **EXPLICIT APPROVAL REQUIREMENT**: No changes may be made without explicit user approval.  
  - Present complete analysis and plan before any modifications.  
  - Wait for clear approval signals: "yes", "approved", "proceed", "go ahead".  
  - Ambiguous responses require clarification before proceeding.  
  - If approval is not given, halt and document as "Pending Approval".  
- **Never** modify functionality without user approval beyond structural improvements.  
- Always back up modified files for traceability.  
- Always begin with a checkpoint commit to ensure rollback safety.  
- Delete obsolete files only after successful validation.  
- If uncertainty arises, pause and request clarification.  
- **For `scope=current`**: Always identify and propose key assignments before proceeding.  

---

## Clean Exit Guarantee (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS)
At the end of every refactor - **ALL CONDITIONS MUST BE MET**:
- **CRITICAL**: Execute `dotnet build --configuration Release` with **ZERO ERRORS AND ZERO WARNINGS**.  
- **CRITICAL**: Execute `dotnet build --configuration Debug` with **ZERO ERRORS AND ZERO WARNINGS**.  
- **CRITICAL**: Run `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` with no formatting issues.  
- **CRITICAL**: Execute `Workspaces/CodeQuality/run-roslynator.ps1` with ZERO unresolved diagnostics.  
- All analyzers, linters, and Roslynator checks must pass with **ZERO** issues (not just "no blocking" issues).  
- All automated tests (unit, integration, Playwright) must pass with 100% success rate.  
- API contracts must remain intact and validated with zero breaking changes.  
- No obsolete or broken code paths may remain.  
- **BUILD COMMANDS FOR VALIDATION:**  
  - `dotnet clean && dotnet build --configuration Release --verbosity normal`  
  - `dotnet clean && dotnet build --configuration Debug --verbosity normal`  
  - `dotnet format --verify-no-changes --verbosity diagnostic`  
- **Instruction files must be consistent** with refactored codebase:  
  - `SystemStructureSummary.md` accurately reflects component relationships  
  - `NOOR-CANVAS_ARCHITECTURE.MD` matches current system design  
  - `API-Contract-Validation.md` aligns with actual API implementations  
  - All cross-references between instruction files remain valid  
- **Key management system must be accurate** with proper lifecycle tracking.  

**FAILURE PROTOCOL**: If ANY of these conditions fail, the refactor must be considered **INCOMPLETE** and marked accordingly in the confirmation output. **IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK** to checkpoint commit is required.

---

## Mandatory Validation Commands
**Execute these commands in sequence - ALL must succeed with zero warnings/errors:**

1. **Clean Build Validation:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet clean
   dotnet build --configuration Release --verbosity normal
   dotnet build --configuration Debug --verbosity normal
   ```

2. **Code Quality Validation:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet format --verify-no-changes --verbosity diagnostic
   ```

3. **Static Analysis Validation:**
   ```powershell
   .\Workspaces\CodeQuality\run-roslynator.ps1
   ```

4. **Test Suite Validation:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet test --configuration Release --verbosity normal
   ```

**REQUIREMENT**: Each command must complete with exit code 0 and ZERO warnings. Any failure triggers immediate rollback.

---

## DTO Mapping Integrity
All refactors must include a **cross-layer DTO mapping audit**:  

- **UI Layer**: Razor components’ bound properties must exactly match DTO fields.  
- **Service Layer**: Deserialization targets must match API response models, with fully qualified namespaces.  
- **API Layer**: Controller DTOs must align with service and database schemas.  
- **Database Layer**: SQL columns, constraints, and DTO properties must stay in sync.  

### Validation Rules
- Field names must match **exactly** (case-sensitive).  
- No shorthand or aliasing without explicit mapping logic.  
- Explicit transformations must be documented and logged.  
- Any mismatch halts the refactor until resolved.  

### Required Validation Steps
- Run analyzer checks on DTO usage.  
- Cross-reference with `API-Contract-Validation.md`.  
- Confirm mappings in `SystemStructureSummary.md` and `NOOR-CANVAS_ARCHITECTURE.MD`.  
- Validate end-to-end: UI → Service → API → DB.
