  Execute Playwright tests for Noor Canvas in strict headless mode (no UI),
  with robust pre-flight checks, clean port management, and rich logs/artifacts.
  Honor project playwright.config.*, but override any UI drift.
  Run against a pre-running, healthy app instance.

# â€¢ Force silent, no-UI execution: headless=true, no --ui, do not allow headed unless explicitly requested.
# â€¢ Pre-flight: verify app is running & healthy; confirm ports; confirm Playwright install; verify tokens.
# â€¢ Smart notesâ†’ENV mapping; echo final runtime config.
# â€¢ Single worker; artifacts retained on failure; HTML+JSON reports.

guardrails:
  - [headless] If config or env attempts to set headed/ui, override to headless and WARN+CONTINUE.
  - [ui-flag] Abort if `--ui` is present in any computed args; print correction hint.
  - [ports] Validate ports via nc/nc-cleanup tools; if 9091 reserved, allow dynamic ports and echo effective baseURL.
  - [health] Must pass warmup + title check; otherwise stop and print pre-flight steps.
  - [single-worker] Always 1 worker to avoid cross-session crosstalk.
  - [tokens] Validate tokens or fallback; redact when logging.
  - [artifacts] Ensure dirs exist; never commit artifacts; respect .gitignore.
  - [config-honor] Do not override project retries/trace/webServer; only enforce UI bans and headless.
  
  # RETROSPECTIVE REGRESSION PREVENTION (Sept 22, 2025):
  - [html-reporter-detection] Scan test files and config for HTML reporter; ABORT with error if found - causes localhost:9323 blocking.
  - [ssl-validation-method] Verify infrastructure uses https module with rejectUnauthorized: false - fetch() fails with self-signed certs.
  - [blazor-selector-validation] Pre-scan test files for generic selectors (input[type="text"], input[placeholder*="token" i]); WARN about potential failures.
  - [source-code-alignment] If test targets specific Razor components, remind to examine component source for exact placeholders.
  - [url-parameter-awareness] For token entry tests, ensure navigation to base URLs without token parameters.
  - [infrastructure-fail-fast] Infrastructure validation must fail immediately if unhealthy - don't proceed with broken setup.
