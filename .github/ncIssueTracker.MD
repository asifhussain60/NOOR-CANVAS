# NOOR Canvas – Issue Tracker
**How Copilot should use this file**
- Use this for real project state: active issues/TODOs, resolved items, and lessons learned.
- Never mark items “completed” without explicit user approval.
- When proposing changes, update acceptance criteria and tests to match.

**Contents to keep current**
- Status sections (NOT STARTED / IN PROGRESS / AWAITING CONFIRMATION / COMPLETED)
- Links to issue/TODO detail files, test files, and affected code
- Lessons learned (repeat-mistake prevention), DB touchpoints, perf notes
- Guardrails (e.g., use KSESSIONS_DEV only; validate tracker before commits)
