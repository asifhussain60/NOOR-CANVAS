# Compliance Awareness
- Maintain awareness of cleanup protocols across StyleCop, ESLint, and Prettier.
- Record compliance status (e.g., StyleCop warnings=0, ESLint errors=0).
- Include progress summaries with RUN_ID and completion percentages.
- Sync updates received from Retrosync on libraries, tech stack, and infrastructure changes.
