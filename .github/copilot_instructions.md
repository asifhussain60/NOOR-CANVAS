# Noor Canvas ‚Äì GitHub Copilot Self-Learning & Engineering Protocols

**Scope:**  
Self-learning, context-first workspace rules for Copilot Chat tailored to the Noor Canvas app.  
Prevent repeat mistakes, maintain a living Project Ledger, enforce explicit approval for issue resolution, and self-review every answer.

_Last Updated: September 20, 2025_

## Always Start with Context

- Read recent chat + key repo files (`README`, configs, migrations, env keys, contracts).
- Maintain/update **Project Ledger** (stack, ports, DBs, tokens, testing rules, design notes).
- For detailed guidance, reference:
  - `.github/engineering-standards.md` ‚Üí coding standards, CI/CD, testing practices
  - `.github/NOOR-Canvas-Mock-Implementation-Guide.md` ‚Üí pixel-perfect design guide
  - `ncImplementationTracker.MD` ‚Üí implementation history, milestones, lessons learned
  - `IssueTracker/ncIssueTracker.MD` ‚Üí issues, TODOs, lessons learned

## Project Overview

**Islamic Content Sharing Platform** ‚Äì Real-time collaborative learning with live annotations, Q&A, and session management.

- **Stack:** ASP.NET Core 8.0 + Blazor Server + SignalR + SQL Server
- **Main App Path:** `SPA/NoorCanvas/`
- **Ports:** 9090 (HTTP), 9091 (HTTPS), 8050 (Docs), 8080 reserved
- **Databases:**
  - `canvas.*` ‚Äì Sessions, Registrations, Questions, Annotations, SecureTokens
  - `KSESSIONS_DEV.dbo.*` ‚Äì Islamic content (read-only in dev)
  - `SessionTranscripts` ‚Äì transcripts (nvarchar(MAX))

**SignalR Hubs:** SessionHub, AnnotationHub, QAHub ‚Üí all follow `"Session_{sessionId}"` pattern.

---

## Standards & Guardrails

### ‚úÖ Do

- Check if app is already running before launch.
- Use `KSESSIONS_DEV` in dev; never prod DB.
- Respect branding: Blue `#3B82F6`, Purple `#8B5CF6`, Inter font, RTL required.
- Load countries dropdown **after** token validation.
- Validate transcripts against DB, not placeholders.
- Prefer existing data over mock data; if mock used, flag in summary.
- Apply incremental changes; validate DB connections before queries.
- Use proper error handling/logging; professional filenames only.
- Keep TEMP workspace for experimental/debug files.

### ‚ùå Don‚Äôt

- Don‚Äôt run multiple servers on 9090/9091.
- Don‚Äôt hardcode tokens/transcripts.
- Don‚Äôt run Playwright UI tests from terminal (Test Explorer only).
- Don‚Äôt auto-mark TODOs/issues as resolved.
- Don‚Äôt bypass tracker validation or validation hooks without approval.
- Don‚Äôt use curl for HTTPS; prefer `Invoke-WebRequest` after server check.
- Don‚Äôt use unprofessional file names (`new`, `fixed`, `temp`).

### üîí Critical Guardrails

- Ask before destructive actions (kill, clear TEMP, bypass hooks).
- Never bypass `validate-tracker-consistency.ps1` without approval.
- All Playwright UI testing must be run **via VSCode Test Explorer** only.

## Issue Resolution Protocol

### **CRITICAL RULE:**

**Never mark issues as resolved without explicit user approval.**

- **Violation Alert (Sep 17, 2025):** Copilot auto-closed issues against instructions. Protocol now enforced globally.

#### Workflow

1. **Complete Technical Work** ‚Äì Implement, test, validate, ensure build success.
2. **Document Progress** ‚Äì Update issue tracker, note findings, blockers, implementation details.
3. **Present Findings** ‚Äì Summarize what was done, show evidence (builds, tests, screenshots).
4. **Wait for User Confirmation** ‚Äì Only accept phrases like:
   - ‚Äúmark as resolved‚Äù
   - ‚Äúapprove this resolution‚Äù
   - ‚Äúthis is complete‚Äù
   - ‚Äúclose this issue‚Äù  
     Never assume approval from positive feedback.
5. **Only Then Update Status** ‚Äì Change from `ACTIVE` ‚Üí `RESOLVED` with resolution date and notes.

#### Status Indicators

- `ACTIVE` ‚Äì Work in progress
- `ACTIVE - AWAITING USER APPROVAL` ‚Äì Technical work complete, awaiting approval
- `RESOLVED` ‚Äì Only after explicit approval
- `DEFERRED` ‚Äì User postponed
- `CANCELLED` ‚Äì User decided not to proceed

## Self-Review (Every Answer)

- Did I answer exactly what was asked?
- Could reading logs/files replace running commands?
- Did I repeat a mistake? ‚Üí Add to **Don‚Äôt** list.
- Provide 1‚Äì3 reminders for the next turn.
- Ensure issue status is **never advanced without explicit approval**.

## Output Shape

1. **Plan** ‚Äì steps
2. **Context Evidence** ‚Äì files/lines referenced
3. **Action** ‚Äì idempotent commands/edits
4. **Result** ‚Äì expected outcome
5. **Self-Review** ‚Äì checklist
6. **Project Ledger** ‚Äì updated snapshot

## Quick Commands (Workspaces/Global/)

```powershell
nc 215             # Session: token + build + launch
nc                 # Generic build + launch
nct create 123     # Standalone token generation
ncdoc              # Documentation (port 8050)
iiskill            # Process cleanup
```
