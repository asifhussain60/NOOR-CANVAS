## 🧠 How BRAIN Works

### 1. Event Capture (Automatic)
Every KDS agent logs events in this format:
```json
{"timestamp":"ISO8601","event":"event_type",...fields}
```

**Event types:**
- `intent_detected` - Router detected user intent
- `file_modified` - Executor modified a file
- `files_modified_together` - Multiple files changed together
- `correction` - User corrected Copilot
- `validation_failed/passed` - Health check results
- `test_created/passed/failed` - Test lifecycle
- `session_started/completed` - Session lifecycle

### 2. Event Processing (Periodic)
Brain Updater (`brain-updater.md`) processes events:
- Reads new events from `events.jsonl`
- Identifies patterns (successful routings, file relationships, etc.)
- Aggregates into structured knowledge
- Updates `knowledge-graph.yaml`

**Triggers:**
- After 50+ new events
- End of session
- Manual: `#file:.github/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md`

### 3. Knowledge Querying (Real-time)
Brain Query (`brain-query.md`) provides insights:
- Intent confidence (Router asks: "What intent for this phrase?")
- Related files (Executor asks: "What files are commonly modified with this one?")
- Correction prevention (Corrector asks: "Is this file commonly confused?")
- Workflow prediction (Planner asks: "What's the typical workflow?")
- Validation insights (Validator asks: "What are common failures?")

### 4. Learning Loop
```
Request → Query BRAIN → Make decision → Log event → Process event → Update knowledge → Better next time
```

## 📊 What BRAIN Learns

### 1. Intent Patterns
```yaml
plan:
  successful_phrases:
    - pattern: "add a * button"
      confidence: 0.95
      frequency: 12
```
**Benefit:** Faster, more accurate routing

### 2. File Relationships
```yaml
HostControlPanelContent.razor:
  common_changes_with:
    wwwroot/css/noor-canvas.css: 0.75  # Modified together 75% of time
```
**Benefit:** Suggest related files proactively

### 3. Correction History
```yaml
file_mismatch:
  common_mistakes:
    - incorrect: "HostControlPanel.razor"
      correct: "HostControlPanelContent.razor"
      frequency: 12
```
**Benefit:** Warn before repeating mistakes

### 4. Workflow Patterns
```yaml
UI_feature_workflow:
  sequence: [plan, execute, test, validate]
  success_rate: 0.92
  frequency: 45
```
**Benefit:** Recommend optimal workflows

### 5. Validation Insights
```yaml
linting:
  failure_rate: 0.15
  common_fix: "fix-copilotchats-violations.ps1"
  fix_success_rate: 0.95
```
**Benefit:** Pre-apply known fixes

### 6. Feature Components
```yaml
fab_button:
  primary_files: [HostControlPanelContent.razor]
  style_files: [wwwroot/css/noor-canvas.css]
  test_files: [Tests/UI/fab-button.spec.ts]
```
**Benefit:** Understand feature scope

## 🚀 Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **Faster routing** - Skip pattern matching for known phrases
- ✅ **Fewer mistakes** - Learn from corrections
- ✅ **Better suggestions** - Know which files are related
- ✅ **Continuous improvement** - Gets smarter with every use

### For KDS System
- ✅ **Self-improving** - No manual pattern updates needed
- ✅ **Transparent** - All knowledge is human-readable YAML/JSON
- ✅ **Local** - 100% in `.github/`, zero external dependencies
- ✅ **Explainable** - Can see WHY a decision was made

---

## 🎯 Usage

### Automatic (Standard Practice)
Just use KDS normally:
```markdown
#file:.github/prompts/user/kds.md
[your request]
```

BRAIN works in the background:
- Events logged automatically
- Knowledge graph updated periodically
- Queries happen transparently

### First-Time Setup
Populate BRAIN from existing sessions:
```powershell
.\.github\scripts\populate-kds-brain.ps1
```

Then update knowledge graph:
```markdown
#file:.github/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
```

### Manual Operations
**Query BRAIN:**
```markdown
#file:.github/prompts/internal/brain-query.md
query_type: intent_confidence
phrase: "add share button"
```

**Update BRAIN:**
```markdown
#file:.github/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md

Process all new events and update knowledge graph
```

## 📋 Integration Points

### Intent Router (Enhanced)
```
Step 0: Query BRAIN for intent confidence
  ↓
If confidence >= 0.70: Use BRAIN recommendation
If confidence < 0.70: Use pattern matching
  ↓
Log routing decision to events.jsonl
```

### Future Integration Opportunities
All agents can leverage BRAIN:

**work-planner.md:**
- Query workflow patterns
- Suggest typical task sequences
- Estimate based on historical data

**code-executor.md:**
- Query related files
- Warn about file confusion
- Suggest co-modified files

**error-corrector.md:**
- Check correction history
- Prevent repeated mistakes
- Learn from user corrections

**test-generator.md:**
- Map tests to source files
- Learn test patterns
- Track test success rates

**health-validator.md:**
- Pre-apply common fixes
- Focus on failure-prone files
- Use high-success-rate solutions

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Compliance

**What's Stored:**
- ✅ File paths (local only)
- ✅ Intent patterns (phrases used)
- ✅ Workflow sequences
- ✅ Validation results

**What's NOT Stored:**
- ❌ File contents (code)
- ❌ Credentials
- ❌ User identity
- ❌ External URLs

**Location:**
- ✅ 100% local (`.github/kds-brain/`)
- ✅ Plain text (YAML/JSON)
- ✅ Human-readable
- ✅ No external transmission

---

## 🎓 Event Logging Standard

All KDS agents MUST log events:
```jsonl
{"timestamp":"2025-11-02T10:30:00Z","event":"event_type",...fields}
```

**Required fields:**
- `timestamp` (ISO 8601)
- `event` (event type)

**Common patterns:**
```json
{"timestamp":"...","event":"intent_detected","intent":"plan","phrase":"add button","confidence":0.95}
{"timestamp":"...","event":"file_modified","file":"File.razor","session":"session-id"}
{"timestamp":"...","event":"correction","type":"file_mismatch","incorrect":"A","correct":"B"}
```

---

## 🏆 Achievement Unlocked

**KDS v5.0 now has:**
- ✅ SOLID architecture (8 focused agents)
- ✅ Dependency Inversion (abstractions for flexibility)
- ✅ Self-learning BRAIN (gets smarter over time)
- ✅ Zero external dependencies (100% local)
- ✅ Open source library policy (clear guidelines)

**This makes KDS the most intelligent, self-improving development system!** 🧠
